[2022/7/21 05:11:12] Eric Gao: Hi Sunaya, this is Eric from the Linux group. Just received that email from Mr. Juan, are you in Plaza Inn too?
[2022/7/21 05:21:28] Sunaya: Yes
[2022/7/21 05:22:02] Sunaya: My flight's on the 22nd
[2022/7/21 05:22:17] Sunaya: And I have to quarantine for a day
[2022/7/21 05:23:24] Sunaya: So I'll be there till 23-24
[2022/7/21 05:35:21] Eric Gao: oh ok
[2022/7/21 05:35:37] Eric Gao: I would quarantine for 5 days as I arrived on 19th, and I would leave on 24th
[2022/7/21 06:12:56] Sunaya: Are you staying there too?
[2022/7/21 06:13:20] Sunaya: Oh nice. We might run into each other there
[2022/7/21 06:15:10] Sunaya: Just saw the email, looks like we'll be traveling together
[2022/7/21 06:27:32] Eric Gao: yes I'm currently in plaza inn
[2022/7/21 06:28:34] Eric Gao: are you sure that you would leave on the 24th though? my flight arrived on 1am on the 20th, but since I booked the hotel for 5 days starting from 7.19, I could leave on the 24th
[2022/7/21 06:29:37] Eric Gao: so it doesn't really matter when you arrive (unless you check in too late, but in my case it wasn't even late). the hotel focuses more on your booking
[2022/7/21 06:37:39] Sunaya: Hmm right. I arrive on 22:45 and my booking's for the 22nd so I guess I could leave on the 23rd
[2022/7/23 09:09:11] Sunaya: Hey Eric, your quarantine's ending tomorrow right?
[2022/7/23 09:09:37] Sunaya: Mine ended today and I'm currently in the males qf housing
[2022/7/23 09:09:48] Eric Gao: yea I would get out tomorrow
[2022/7/23 09:09:57] Eric Gao: so great!
[2022/7/23 09:10:22] Sunaya: Yup just need the card to be ready and I'm good to go
[2022/7/23 09:10:38] Eric Gao: you mean the room card?
[2022/7/23 09:10:41] Sunaya: Yes
[2022/7/23 09:10:46] Eric Gao: oh ok
[2022/7/23 09:10:59] Eric Gao: do you like the student dorm?
[2022/7/23 09:11:17] Sunaya: Haven't been in yet? I'm in the waiting room
[2022/7/23 09:11:56] Eric Gao: oh ok
[2022/7/23 09:11:56] Sunaya: I've got some videos of the room tho. A friend of mine sent it to me
[2022/7/23 09:12:07] Eric Gao: yea I really liked the rooms from the video

[2022/7/23 09:12:56] Sunaya: Idk. Haven't thought of anything yet
[2022/7/23 09:13:16] Sunaya: I'll try to find other cmu plp and maybe we can do something together
[2022/7/23 09:13:41] Sunaya: I think imron already here right
[2022/7/23 09:13:43] Eric Gao: do you have a qatar phone card yet? i think it's best to get one. many apps such as delivery and taxi need a card
[2022/7/23 09:13:47] Eric Gao: yea imron is here
[2022/7/23 09:13:51] Eric Gao: you can text him
[2022/7/23 09:13:58] Sunaya: I bought one but it's a tourist one
[2022/7/23 09:14:17] Sunaya: It's only valid for like 7 days I'll buy a local one quickly
[2022/7/23 09:14:26] Eric Gao: yea good idea
[2022/7/23 09:14:33] Sunaya: Did you buy yours?
[2022/7/23 09:14:43] Sunaya: In the airport?
[2022/7/23 09:14:58] Eric Gao: no. unfortunately I didn't find the place in the airport😂
[2022/7/23 09:15:14] Eric Gao: it was in midnight and I couldn't wait for another second to go to bed
[2022/7/23 09:15:16] Sunaya: Haha I found the place but I didn't know they had a local and a tourist one
[2022/7/23 09:15:31] Sunaya: I just asked them to hand me a sim lol
[2022/7/23 09:15:36] Sunaya: Same
[2022/7/23 09:15:45] Eric Gao: I heard from some seniors that the vodafone has better signals in male student dorm
[2022/7/23 09:16:08] Sunaya: Nice I have orodee rn I'll buy Vodafone then
[2022/7/23 09:16:08] Eric Gao: you could ask imron though. he's been here a few days and he seems to know a bit around education city
[2022/7/23 09:16:17] Sunaya: Yeah that'll be ideal
[2022/7/23 09:16:46] Sunaya: Oh yeah I met Adan too today. She was in Plaza Inn too
[2022/7/23 09:17:08] Eric Gao: oh really? how amazingly coincidental😂
[2022/7/23 09:17:47] Eric Gao: you could find a local restaurant and have some non-quarantine food. i miss it so much
[2022/7/23 09:17:49] Sunaya: Ikr if only your quarantine was a day less we all wouldve met thete
[2022/7/23 09:17:52] Sunaya: There
[2022/7/23 09:17:58] Eric Gao: yea we would
[2022/7/23 09:18:09] Sunaya: Haha right. The quarantine food was so bad
[2022/7/23 09:18:18] Sunaya: I could barely finish half
[2022/7/23 09:18:22] Eric Gao: yea me too
[2022/7/23 09:18:28] Eric Gao: I didn't like the taste of the rice
[2022/7/23 09:18:31] Sunaya: And I was there for only a day.
[2022/7/23 09:18:46] Sunaya: The chicken was dry and bland too

[2022/8/4 04:11:48] Eric Gao: You should email Juan about it if you’re joining
[2022/8/4 04:12:36] Sunaya: Yes I think I'll ask him in person
[2022/8/4 04:12:47] Sunaya: What did he say in your email?
[2022/8/4 04:13:29] Eric Gao: Hi all,

I understand you have a conflict with your medical appointment that is difficult to change.

What you can do is go to the Medical Commision right after class, by 4pm. I recommend going at this time and not later than that, and definitely before 6pm. This may mean you miss other classes, but this is a mandatory government process and you need to get this done today.

For now, you are responsible for your own transportation - if that changes I will let you know.

Once you go, you will get your appointment receipts stamped, and once you have all done so, please go to the 1st floor to the X-ray section, and find Mr. Mohammad Abduljawar and explain that you are from CMUQ in QF, and he will help you get through the crowd.

If you still plan on going with the 1pm group, please reply and tell me.

Let me know if there are any issues.

Best,

[2022/8/21 02:57:07] Eric Gao: I know that he needs a monitor
[2022/8/21 02:57:12] Sunaya: Oh yeah
[2022/8/21 02:57:20] Sunaya: He's always talking about that
[2022/8/21 02:57:28] Eric Gao: but most monitors are like at least 1000 riiyals
[2022/8/21 02:57:43] Sunaya: Ikr too expensive
[2022/8/21 02:57:53] Sunaya: Anything else that he keeps mentioning
[2022/8/21 02:57:59] Eric Gao: also the body size pillow
[2022/8/21 02:58:06] Eric Gao: but I didn't find anywhere that sells them
[2022/8/21 02:58:07] Sunaya: Oh wow yeah
[2022/8/21 02:58:21] Sunaya: Did you ask hoalin he might know

[2022/8/21 02:59:12] Sunaya: I saw one normal one in a mall
[2022/8/21 02:59:20] Sunaya: Anime one or a normal?
[2022/8/21 02:59:31] Eric Gao: he said normal one is fine, but what's the fun of it
[2022/8/21 02:59:49] Sunaya: Ikr
[2022/8/21 03:00:05] Eric Gao: better be some nsfw things on the pillow
[2022/8/21 03:00:05] Sunaya: There's normals ones I'll try to find an anime one
[2022/8/21 03:00:10] Eric Gao: and let's also buy him a condom
[2022/8/21 03:00:34] Sunaya: Yess
[2022/8/21 03:00:55] Sunaya: I wanted to buy you one as well but yeah
[2022/8/21 03:01:25] Eric Gao: I'm 18 now so I can properly buy one
[2022/8/21 03:01:45] Sunaya: i think in qatar you need to be married to buy one
[2022/8/21 03:01:54] Sunaya: you need to show your marriage certificate lol
[2022/8/21 03:01:59] Eric Gao: oh really
[2022/8/21 03:02:07] Sunaya: nah i'm joking
[2022/8/21 03:02:13] Sunaya: but it's probably true considering qatar
[2022/8/21 03:02:35] Eric Gao: yea
[2022/8/21 03:04:18] Sunaya: we could buy a normal body pillow and buy a seperate nsfw body pillow cover
[2022/8/21 03:04:34] Eric Gao: I'm not sure where we could find the nsfw cover
[2022/8/21 03:04:49] Sunaya: okay not nsfw but anime cover
[2022/8/21 03:05:01] Eric Gao: it's so easy in China to get a customized body pillow
[2022/8/21 03:05:22] Eric Gao: you order on taobao and 3 days later it's in your house
[2022/8/21 03:05:48] Eric Gao: also I'm not sure where to find the anime cover
[2022/8/21 03:05:56] Sunaya: hmm lemeee ask some qatari residents if they know
[2022/8/21 03:06:15] Sunaya: body pillow would be such a good gift for lorenzo

[2022/8/21 03:06:54] Eric Gao: yea
[2022/8/21 03:07:14] Eric Gao: I think there is an anime store in villagio
[2022/8/21 03:07:25] Eric Gao: if anything, it would be our best chance
[2022/8/21 03:09:05] Eric Gao: btw I know that buying condom in saudi arabia needs a marriage licsence
[2022/8/21 03:09:22] Sunaya: lol
[2022/8/21 03:09:35] Sunaya: could be same in qatar you never know
[2022/8/21 03:13:03] Eric Gao: I just searched and it says: if the pharmarcy store owner suspects you of premarriage sex, he would report you to the police
[2022/8/21 03:13:44] Sunaya: damn yeah let's not buy
[2022/8/21 03:29:37] Sunaya: eric for the concepts hw the last sets one can we use de morgans law and other set identical theories to prove if the sets are equivalent

[2022/9/11 14:28:41] Sunaya: i'm participating haven't registered yet tho
[2022/9/11 14:28:52] Eric Gao: Mohamed asked me to team with him
[2022/9/11 14:28:58] Eric Gao: The one with short hair
[2022/9/11 14:29:06] Sunaya: yea sure
[2022/9/11 14:29:09] Eric Gao: Ok

[2022/9/11 14:30:26] Sunaya: also wait let me ask zeina and aditya since i teamed up with them last time. if they aren't participating i'm teaming up with you
[2022/9/11 14:31:10] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/9/12 03:48:30] Eric Gao: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lfgSeu0nLhk
[2022/9/12 03:48:35] Eric Gao: This you?
[2022/9/13 00:52:10] Sunaya: I'll be a bit late
[2022/9/13 00:53:26] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/9/14 11:41:56] Sunaya: eric how do you do the concepts hw no 2
 i proved that its injective how do i prove its surjective
[2022/9/14 11:43:37] Eric Gao: express x'=x+y y'=2y+z z'=x-z in terms of x y z
[2022/9/14 11:44:21] Eric Gao: e.g. x=ax'+by'+cz' etc.
[2022/9/14 11:48:56] Sunaya: did you find the inverse and prove that it's a bijection?
[2022/9/14 11:49:08] Eric Gao: after you express those
[2022/9/14 11:49:16] Eric Gao: put them into f(x,y,z)
[2022/9/14 11:49:28] Eric Gao: and you'll get f=(x,y,z)
[2022/9/14 11:49:51] Eric Gao: it's not technically a inverse
[2022/9/14 11:50:03] Eric Gao: because inverse would require it to be bijection
[2022/9/14 11:50:06] Eric Gao: which we need to prove now
[2022/9/14 11:50:14] Sunaya: oh from the inverse get the values of x y and z
[2022/9/14 11:50:29] Sunaya: and use that to show that it's surjective right
[2022/9/14 11:51:20] Eric Gao: same as how you prove other things are surjective
[2022/9/14 11:51:29] Sunaya: oh right right
[2022/9/14 11:51:30] Sunaya: i got it
[2022/9/14 11:51:32] Eric Gao: suppose there is (x,y,z) in R3
[2022/9/14 11:51:42] Eric Gao: and so on
[2022/9/15 00:57:32] Sunaya: I am in the lobby
[2022/9/15 09:37:13] Sunaya: I'm in library when you're going to guq let me know
[2022/9/15 09:40:49] Eric Gao: ok
[2022/9/17 02:16:06] Sunaya: Eric what do you use to clean the bathroom floors?
[2022/9/17 02:16:17] Eric Gao: mob
[2022/9/17 02:16:23] Eric Gao: but not really the one I wanted

[2022/9/23 04:06:02] Eric Gao: for phones yes because you could easily drop them
[2022/9/23 04:06:05] Sunaya: You never know if you'd don't try. Learning experience
[2022/9/23 04:06:33] Eric Gao: you don't need protector for ipad the same reason you don't need protective cases for laptop
[2022/9/23 04:06:59] Eric Gao: a large and flat surface like that gets crushed no matter what you do
[2022/9/23 04:07:24] Sunaya: Too dumb to thin

[2022/9/23 04:08:16] Sunaya: I'll just get a case now
[2022/9/23 04:08:26] Sunaya: And remove the protector cause I hate the feel.of it
[2022/9/23 04:08:35] Sunaya: It's so bad
[2022/9/23 04:08:36] Eric Gao: why is the screen protector bad?
[2022/9/23 04:08:49] Sunaya: I bought paper like protector
[2022/9/23 04:08:59] Sunaya: So writing is paper like

[2022/9/26 11:25:33] Sunaya: Yeah a headphone
[2022/9/26 11:25:40] Eric Gao: ???????
[2022/9/26 11:25:54] Eric Gao: you might want to watch out for her
[2022/9/26 11:26:04] Eric Gao: today's candy may become tomorrow's whip
[2022/9/26 11:26:13] Eric Gao: I mean sexually
[2022/9/26 11:26:57] Eric Gao: and I'm looking forward to being "friends" with her
[2022/9/26 11:27:07] Sunaya: What the heck
[2022/9/26 11:28:36] Eric Gao: why did she give this to you
[2022/9/26 11:28:40] Eric Gao: you wanted it so badly?
[2022/9/26 11:28:44] Sunaya: No
[2022/9/26 11:28:53] Sunaya: Because I won Aditya in rock paper scissors
[2022/9/26 11:29:03] Eric Gao: what?
[2022/9/26 11:29:08] Sunaya: She said whoever wins would get one

[2022/9/26 11:29:25] Eric Gao: fuck
[2022/9/26 11:29:31] Sunaya: I thought she was joking
[2022/9/26 11:29:47] Sunaya: I was speechless when she handed me that
[2022/9/26 11:31:42] Sunaya: I still don't know what to do? Like what I just can't think straight
[2022/9/26 11:31:58] Sunaya: How can someone just hand me something so expensive
[2022/9/26 11:34:08] Eric Gao: this is what she wanted
[2022/9/26 11:34:40] Eric Gao: that you become puzzled and you start trying to offer her your personal values to compensate for the expensive gift and gradually you become her sex slave
[2022/9/26 11:35:04] Eric Gao: or it's just like she actually doesn't care
[2022/9/26 11:35:23] Eric Gao: you would feel more self-respect if you think the former way
[2022/9/26 11:35:54] Eric Gao: but the later is more possible
[2022/9/26 11:36:02] Eric Gao: or is it?

[2022/10/26 13:57:15] Eric Gao: ok
[2022/10/26 13:57:21] Eric Gao: how's it going with your project
[2022/10/26 13:59:57] Sunaya: no progress, I started creating the player, drawing him and then it just went downhill
[2022/10/26 14:00:19] Sunaya: but now i'm using tiled to create the map and character once that's done i'll work on the player and then enemies
[2022/10/26 14:00:39] Sunaya: oh yeah and I looked over brotato my game will be similar
[2022/10/26 14:02:52] Eric Gao: brotato is a very small game of its genre but it's still way too big for your project
[2022/10/26 14:02:57] Sunaya: code wise it's still TP1 no progess from tp1
[2022/10/26 14:03:19] Eric Gao: and don't start with player drawing, it takes much more time and thinking than writing code
[2022/10/26 14:03:38] Eric Gao: find some sample art online and change them afterwards
[2022/10/26 14:03:47] Sunaya: yea ig I'll do that

‎[2022/11/5 13:02:07] Sunaya:‎<附件：00001351-PHOTO-2022-11-05-13-02-07.jpg>

[2022/11/5 13:18:57] Sunaya: i  think the ans for 4 is this
[2022/11/5 13:32:39] Eric Gao: you're right
[2022/11/5 13:32:57] Eric Gao: it is the 4th calculation error I made on this single homework in less than 2 hours
[2022/11/5 13:33:01] Eric Gao: I might have brain cancer
[2022/11/5 13:38:51] Sunaya: for 3 you got m = 0.5 and b = 0.25 right?

[2022/11/6 03:53:18] Sunaya: eric

[2022/11/6 03:55:49] Sunaya: as soon as you see Lorenzo tell him i'm looking fo r him
[2022/11/6 03:56:05] Sunaya: i need to calculate how much i need in the final for matrices to get an A
[2022/11/6 03:57:35] Eric Gao: what's the point in knowing it
[2022/11/6 03:57:40] Sunaya: i don't think i'll get an A
[2022/11/6 03:57:52] Sunaya: cause like my percent is 95.16 now
[2022/11/6 03:57:55] Eric Gao: does that affect in anyways who you are or what you do?
[2022/11/6 03:58:15] Eric Gao: remember last time I got 80 for concepts midterm? my average dropped to 90.5
[2022/11/6 03:58:16] Sunaya: if i get 60 in this midterm i will need to get 100% in the final right?
[2022/11/6 03:59:07] Eric Gao: ignorance is bless, always
[2022/11/6 03:59:32] Eric Gao: if you knowing it doesn't make a positive influence compared to not knowing it, don't try to know it
[2022/11/6 04:00:18] Eric Gao: 2 things I always tell myself: there are things I cannot do and thus I won't do, and there are things I cannot know and thus I won't know
[2022/11/6 04:00:39] Sunaya: knowing it would give let me know if i could get an A or B and plan accordingly
[2022/11/6 04:00:46] Eric Gao: plan for an A, always
[2022/11/6 04:01:13] Eric Gao: at least for me so that I don't suffer the pain of knowing stuff
[2022/11/6 04:02:26] Eric Gao: actually plan for doing your best, no matter the result
[2022/11/6 04:02:42] Eric Gao: remember prof. Saquib said to enjoy the process not the results
[2022/11/6 04:03:52] Eric Gao: and I've known you for 3 months. not even once did you let me down
[2022/11/6 04:04:11] Sunaya: i checked my concepts

[2022/11/6 04:04:47] Sunaya: i was amazed as you were
[2022/11/6 04:05:26] Sunaya: now i feel like all that i said before is invalidated

[2022/11/6 04:09:45] Sunaya: what do this mean? are you angry i literally didn't know

[2022/11/6 04:10:47] Eric Gao: I'm just trying to mock you for showing all the drama
[2022/11/6 04:11:08] Sunaya: i know but i didn't wanna do that. i was just expressing what i felt
[2022/11/6 04:11:16] Eric Gao: that's why I wasn't angry
[2022/11/6 04:11:38] Eric Gao: and you won't know if I'm angry if I'm truly angry
[2022/11/6 04:11:48] Eric Gao: I'm expressing my feelings only when they are useful
[2022/11/6 04:12:16] Eric Gao: anyways now that you're happier, try to worry less about matrix
[2022/11/6 04:16:26] Sunaya: anyways, i'm sorry i was too dramatic i really didn't want it to happen that way
[2022/11/6 04:16:46] Eric Gao: No don’t be sorry

[2022/11/13 23:47:06] Sunaya: At 8?

[2022/11/13 23:47:40] Eric Gao: Come get me when you’re ready
[2022/11/13 23:47:45] Sunaya: Ok
[2022/11/14 00:44:19] Sunaya: eric how would you do c) using answer from b)
‎[2022/11/14 00:44:22] Sunaya:‎<附件：00001500-PHOTO-2022-11-14-00-44-22.jpg>
[2022/11/14 00:44:42] Sunaya: the prof said the answer is 3v1
[2022/11/14 00:45:00] Eric Gao: I forgot what b is
[2022/11/14 00:45:27] Eric Gao: It’s a stochastic matrix so 1 is the dominant eigenvalue
[2022/11/14 00:45:44] Sunaya: yea but A is stochastic matrix
[2022/11/14 00:45:46] Eric Gao: It tends to the eigenvector corresponding to 1
[2022/11/14 00:46:12] Sunaya: is A^k stochastic matrix as well?
[2022/11/14 00:46:29] Eric Gao: It should be
[2022/11/14 00:46:39] Eric Gao: I don’t know
[2022/11/14 00:47:00] Eric Gao: w is the x0 in this case
[2022/11/14 00:47:19] Eric Gao: If you write x0 as c1v1+c2v2+c3v3
[2022/11/14 00:47:55] Eric Gao: Then A^kx0=c1lambda1^k+…
[2022/11/14 00:48:13] Eric Gao: Then A^kx0=c1lambda1^kv1+…
[2022/11/14 00:49:14] Sunaya: yea that the other two become zero but c1A^kv1 is not zero but I don't get it
[2022/11/14 00:49:21] Sunaya: wait I'll come in your room
[2022/11/14 02:35:16] Sunaya: Eric do you have extra pen I can borrow for today?

[2022/11/14 02:54:27] Eric Gao: lemme go ask
[2022/11/14 02:55:09] Sunaya: transpose(A)*b = projB onto A right?
[2022/11/14 02:58:56] Eric Gao: maybe
[2022/11/14 03:34:17] Sunaya: Imma go sleep
[2022/11/14 03:34:58] Sunaya: Let's eat food at 1230 from the cafeteria

[2022/11/14 03:35:21] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/11/14 04:27:40] Sunaya: I am awake
[2022/11/14 04:27:49] Sunaya: I'll shower and come to the common area

[2022/11/18 22:39:41] Eric Gao: No thanks
[2022/11/18 22:41:10] Eric Gao: You could take them with you to indigrill
[2022/11/20 16:26:19] Sunaya: What you doing?
[2022/11/20 16:26:41] Eric Gao: Walking around airport looking at things I have no money to buy
[2022/11/20 16:27:22] Sunaya: Only an hour and half to go?
[2022/11/20 16:27:28] Eric Gao: Yes
[2022/11/20 16:27:38] Sunaya: Send proof
[2022/11/20 16:28:06] Eric Gao: Penhaligon perfumes cost 150 dollars
[2022/11/20 16:28:33] Sunaya: Proff you're in the airport
[2022/11/20 16:28:38] Eric Gao: This place doesn’t sell any silver stuff, only gold and jewelry
[2022/11/20 16:28:56] Sunaya: How much was the cheapest one?
[2022/11/20 16:29:01] Sunaya: Necklace
[2022/11/20 16:29:07] Sunaya: And was it goof
[2022/11/20 16:29:18] Eric Gao: Proof by contradiction: if I weren’t in airport, I would have been asleep. QED
[2022/11/20 16:29:26] Eric Gao: 150 dollars
[2022/11/20 16:29:32] Eric Gao: What is good
[2022/11/20 16:29:36] Eric Gao: *goof
[2022/11/20 16:29:48] Sunaya: What do you rate your necklace
[2022/11/20 16:31:13] Eric Gao: 8/10
[2022/11/20 16:31:30] Eric Gao: Since it’s supposed to be silver but it started turning black
[2022/11/20 16:31:42] Sunaya: Okay compared to that how much would you rate this
[2022/11/20 16:31:59] Eric Gao: No this is the perfume price
[2022/11/20 16:32:11] Eric Gao: Necklace I didn’t even dare to ask
[2022/11/20 16:32:41] Sunaya: Oh I thought you were talking a out he necklace
[2022/11/20 16:32:52] Sunaya: How much was yours tho
[2022/11/20 16:33:01] Eric Gao: I think the cheapest would cost at least 10k riyals
[2022/11/20 16:33:13] Eric Gao: No idea. My mom bought it
[2022/11/20 16:33:21] Sunaya: wtf so expensive
[2022/11/20 16:33:31] Sunaya: But ig it's supposed to be
[2022/11/20 16:33:38] Sunaya: so no complain
[2022/11/20 16:33:42] Eric Gao: The cheaper ones are pure gold
[2022/11/20 16:33:51] Eric Gao: The more expensive ones are pure gold with diamonds
[2022/11/20 16:34:43] Sunaya: What do you rate the Doha airport
[2022/11/20 16:34:51] Sunaya: Compared to china's
[2022/11/20 16:34:55] Eric Gao: 10/10
[2022/11/20 16:35:11] Eric Gao: The biggest and best decorated airport
[2022/11/20 16:35:22] Eric Gao: With no over overpriced stuff
[2022/11/20 16:35:29] Sunaya: Damn we should have come with you
[2022/11/20 16:35:41] Sunaya: Go window shopping in the airport
[2022/11/20 16:35:59] Sunaya: maybe get some stuff
[2022/11/20 16:36:08] Sunaya: Didn't think you'd rate this
[2022/11/20 16:36:23] Eric Gao: Using the money from selling your kidney?
[2022/11/20 16:36:45] Eric Gao: Well maybe 9/10 because I can’t buy anything because everything is too expensive
[2022/11/20 16:36:56] Eric Gao: And there’s too many people today
[2022/11/20 16:36:57] Sunaya: don't have a kidney
[2022/11/20 16:37:15] Sunaya: Contradiction
[2022/11/20 16:37:20] Sunaya: Contradiction
[2022/11/20 16:37:48] Eric Gao: I said over overpriced, not overpriced
[2022/11/20 16:38:14] Eric Gao: Things are expensive but are close to or even cheaper than the normal tax-free market price
[2022/11/20 16:38:38] Eric Gao: In Chinese airports one kfc would cost 50 riyals and you don’t even get full
[2022/11/20 16:39:06] Eric Gao: And all the souvenirs are twice the price compared to outside
[2022/11/20 16:39:33] Sunaya: it's similar to Nepal it's like 3x more
[2022/11/20 16:39:44] Eric Gao: Why are you not sleeping
‎[2022/11/20 16:40:08] Sunaya:‎<附件：00001604-PHOTO-2022-11-20-16-40-08.jpg>
[2022/11/20 16:40:19] Sunaya: Playing games
[2022/11/20 16:40:32] Eric Gao: It’s generally a bad idea to play game over night
[2022/11/20 16:40:51] Sunaya: Yea but I have a lot to complete no time to waste
[2022/11/20 16:40:59] Eric Gao: 80% of the sudden death cases I know of happened during playing game at 1am
[2022/11/20 16:41:18] Eric Gao: You also have a long life to live
[2022/11/20 16:42:18] Sunaya: and a lot of game to play
[2022/11/20 16:43:12] Eric Gao: Do you prefer gaming over living or living over gaming
[2022/11/20 16:43:26] Sunaya: def gaming over living
[2022/11/20 16:43:32] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/11/20 16:43:37] Sunaya: wouldn't you too
[2022/11/20 16:43:40] Eric Gao: No
[2022/11/20 16:43:48] Sunaya: There's no fun in living who would want to live
[2022/11/20 16:43:48] Eric Gao: I want to suffer over eternity
[2022/11/20 16:44:21] Sunaya: You haven't experienced suffering that's why you want it
[2022/11/20 16:45:20] Eric Gao: Maybe maybe not
[2022/11/20 16:45:28] Sunaya: people always want something what they don't have
[2022/11/20 16:45:45] Eric Gao: In eternity suffering and not suffering would not distinguish from each other
[2022/11/20 16:46:22] Eric Gao: I don’t have AIDS but I don’t want it. Proof with counter example
[2022/11/20 16:46:25] Sunaya: So why chose suffering? Choose not suffering for eternity if it is the same
[2022/11/20 16:46:43] Eric Gao: Not the same because I need to type additional characters
[2022/11/20 16:47:19] Sunaya: would you want to suffer now?
[2022/11/20 16:47:26] Sunaya: and suffer in what way
[2022/11/20 16:47:41] Eric Gao: Suffer from suffer
[2022/11/20 16:47:49] Eric Gao: Recursive definition
[2022/11/20 16:47:59] Sunaya: What's the base caee
[2022/11/20 16:48:00] Eric Gao: With no base case
[2022/11/20 16:48:13] Eric Gao: The same way you define the word intelligence
[2022/11/20 16:48:30] Sunaya: I haven't defined it
[2022/11/20 16:48:41] Eric Gao: Recursively defined on the approximation to human intelligence
[2022/11/20 16:49:04] Sunaya: What's the recursive case then
[2022/11/20 16:49:15] Eric Gao: Suffer from the existing suffering
[2022/11/20 16:49:34] Eric Gao: Maybe. I don’t really know
[2022/11/20 16:49:45] Sunaya: how much of an increment each time when you call the func again
[2022/11/20 16:50:04] Eric Gao: Some increment
[2022/11/20 16:50:13] Sunaya: how long does each loop take to reach the func call again
[2022/11/20 16:50:21] Eric Gao: Some time
[2022/11/20 16:50:39] Sunaya: yea very accurate stuff
[2022/11/20 16:50:49] Sunaya: you'll be a mathematician in no time
[2022/11/20 16:50:51] Eric Gao: You cannot really define human
[2022/11/20 16:51:06] Eric Gao: Are you a human and how do you know it
[2022/11/20 16:51:36] Sunaya: It's just a noun
[2022/11/20 16:51:52] Sunaya: what a noun?
[2022/11/20 16:52:09] Sunaya: It's just a sequence of letters
[2022/11/20 16:52:20] Eric Gao: Noun is the grammatical definition, not the definition on its meaning
[2022/11/20 16:52:22] Sunaya: What's a sequence, what's letters?
[2022/11/20 16:52:35] Sunaya: It's just stuff
[2022/11/20 16:52:38] Sunaya: What's stuff?
[2022/11/20 16:52:42] Sunaya: It's things
[2022/11/20 16:52:51] Sunaya: What's things?
[2022/11/20 16:53:08] Eric Gao: Ok stop and go play your games
[2022/11/20 16:53:14] Sunaya: okok
[2022/11/20 16:53:34] Sunaya: you get a cozy chair and play some too
[2022/11/20 16:53:43] Eric Gao: Or suddenly die or sleep
[2022/11/20 16:54:13] Sunaya: I walked a lot today there's no way I'd die
[2022/11/20 16:54:25] Eric Gao: It doesn’t have to do with walking
[2022/11/20 16:56:34] Sunaya: agree to disagree
[2022/11/20 16:56:46] Eric Gao: There’s one way to find out
[2022/11/20 16:58:00] Sunaya: I'll play until 2 let's see who's right
[2022/11/20 16:58:19] Eric Gao: let me know if you die
[2022/11/20 16:58:33] Sunaya: Ok I'll msg here
[2022/11/20 16:58:41] Sunaya: once I die
[2022/11/20 17:36:52] Sunaya: still going strong
[2022/11/20 17:38:41] Eric Gao: 22 more minutes to go
[2022/11/20 17:39:03] Eric Gao: Usually there is no warning
[2022/11/20 18:00:16] Sunaya: am dead
[2022/11/20 23:04:01] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/11/20 23:04:07] Eric Gao: I finally got internet
[2022/11/21 00:07:04] Sunaya: Good
[2022/11/21 02:08:02] Sunaya: you reached your home?
[2022/11/21 02:11:00] Eric Gao: At hk now
[2022/11/21 02:18:19] Sunaya: do you need to quarantine there before you go to your place or no?
[2022/11/21 02:19:22] Eric Gao: Yea
[2022/11/21 02:19:27] Eric Gao: 3 days in hk
[2022/11/21 02:19:34] Eric Gao: Then 8 days in mainland
[2022/11/21 02:19:39] Eric Gao: Then I go back to my house
[2022/11/22 07:30:59] Eric Gao: You know what I’m going to ask
[2022/11/22 07:32:08] Eric Gao: To answer the question that you’ll ask, 100
[2022/11/22 07:50:20] Sunaya: What?
[2022/11/22 07:50:39] Eric Gao: We had a bet
[2022/11/22 07:50:45] Eric Gao: On your matrices
[2022/11/22 07:50:50] Eric Gao: 77
[2022/11/22 07:51:40] Sunaya: Yea we did, it was for the third midterm that I'd get less than 70
[2022/11/22 07:51:45] Sunaya: And I lost
[2022/11/22 07:52:01] Sunaya: Also Enoch was wrong ig
[2022/11/22 07:53:21] Eric Gao: Oh we didn’t have a bet on 77 for the final?
[2022/11/22 07:53:33] Sunaya: No
[2022/11/22 07:53:55] Sunaya: why would I bet on it, the qns were easy
[2022/11/22 07:54:22] Sunaya: i grabbed the calculator that was numbered 77 tho cause I got 77 previously
[2022/11/22 07:55:29] Eric Gao: Oh right
[2022/11/22 07:55:37] Sunaya: What did you get?
[2022/11/22 07:55:45] Sunaya: 100?
[2022/11/22 07:56:05] Sunaya: So we were right about the proof?
[2022/11/22 07:56:14] Eric Gao: See I did predict correctly
[2022/11/22 07:56:33] Sunaya: You'll ask mine now
[2022/11/22 07:56:36] Eric Gao: And I *proved* it right haha
[2022/11/22 07:57:05] Eric Gao: I wasn’t actually laughing. It’s a sarcastic haha to mock the bad pun
[2022/11/22 07:57:16] Eric Gao: Yes

[2022/11/22 07:58:19] Sunaya: I
[2022/11/22 07:58:43] Eric Gao: You need to prove that you predicted before you told me your prediction
[2022/11/22 07:58:55] Eric Gao: I proved by providing the answer not the question
[2022/11/22 07:59:24] Eric Gao: Because me seeing the question changes what I might ask
[2022/11/22 07:59:43] Sunaya: I don't get it but anyways I got 97. I lost 3 on I think the determinant cause I got the wrong value
[2022/11/22 08:00:09] Sunaya: Also this how tho?
[2022/11/22 08:00:36] Eric Gao: Nicenice. Only a calculation error

[2022/11/22 08:01:10] Eric Gao: I don’t know
[2022/11/22 08:01:15] Eric Gao: I might still be right
[2022/11/22 08:01:45] Sunaya: how cause Enoch showed me it was wrong using an example
[2022/11/22 08:01:50] Eric Gao: If A has orthonormal columns biimplies A^-1=A^T
[2022/11/22 08:01:59] Sunaya: Yea I did the same thing

[2023/4/18 17:15:24] Sunaya: it was a stupid assert
[2023/4/18 17:15:32] Sunaya: i put in an assert which cause the problem
[2023/4/19 00:00:44] Eric Gao: Dam
[2023/4/20 02:35:54] Eric Gao: you up?
[2023/4/20 03:13:24] Sunaya: yea why

[2023/4/22 00:02:05] Eric Gao: Yea I think so
[2023/4/22 07:30:52] Sunaya: eric does all the images need to of the same size?
[2023/4/22 07:31:06] Eric Gao: yes if you use CNN
[2023/4/22 07:31:23] Sunaya: oh okay but if i don't use it then it's fine right?
[2023/4/22 07:31:31] Sunaya: is it only for that
[2023/4/22 07:35:50] Eric Gao: as long as you don't directly use all pixels from a image as features
[2023/4/22 07:35:58] Sunaya: okay thanks
[2023/4/22 07:36:03] Eric Gao: p
[2023/4/22 07:48:43] Sunaya: also even if shape is the same resolution can be different right?
[2023/4/22 07:49:04] Sunaya: i made all my pictures of the same shape but they have different resolution
[2023/4/22 07:55:14] Sunaya: omg i was returning the wrong thing nvm
[2023/4/22 07:55:15] Sunaya: thanks
[2023/4/22 07:55:54] Eric Gao: yea same shape means same resolution
[2023/4/22 11:42:34] Sunaya: KNN, Random Forerst and CNN
[2023/4/22 11:42:40] Sunaya: putting it here so i don't forget
[2023/4/22 11:48:55] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/4/22 12:43:55] Sunaya: I used orb only for knn got an accuracy of 0.34 lmao
[2023/4/22 12:44:22] Eric Gao: That’s same as random guessing
[2023/4/22 12:44:32] Sunaya: Exactly
[2023/4/22 12:44:48] Sunaya: how I have no idea
[2023/4/22 12:45:00] Eric Gao: That means at your features are not doing the opposite
[2023/4/22 12:45:11] Sunaya: maybe my image doesn't align with the label
[2023/4/22 12:45:21] Sunaya: but I sort both of them
[2023/4/22 12:45:25] Sunaya: so it should be fine
[2023/4/22 12:46:05] Sunaya: ill try with other features extraction method and see what happens
[2023/4/22 13:05:54] Sunaya: I got 0.47 with lbp
[2023/4/22 13:06:01] Sunaya: at least it improved with that
[2023/4/22 13:06:10] Sunaya: i'll try the other ones now
[2023/4/22 13:06:44] Eric Gao: Good
[2023/4/22 13:06:50] Eric Gao: Just use all the features
[2023/4/22 13:07:08] Sunaya: i'll use one individually and then combine and see
[2023/4/22 13:07:12] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/4/22 13:22:21] Sunaya: we did  Support Vector Machine (SVM) right?
[2023/4/22 13:30:50] Sunaya: hog is taking so long
[2023/4/22 13:31:04] Sunaya: i hate hog
[2023/4/22 13:31:29] Eric Gao: yes
[2023/4/22 13:32:08] Sunaya: if hog runs quick enough I'll be done with the project today I think hopefully
[2023/4/22 13:32:38] Sunaya: ok
[2023/4/22 13:32:43] Sunaya: where's your ok
[2023/4/22 13:32:59] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/4/22 14:19:41] Sunaya: the code hasn't finished running yet :(
[2023/4/22 14:27:23] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/4/22 14:47:25] Sunaya: finally the code ran to completion with an error
[2023/4/22 14:47:35] Eric Gao: Sheesh
[2023/4/22 14:47:47] Eric Gao: Try running on a subsample when debugging
[2023/4/22 14:47:59] Sunaya: oh yea right god damn you a genius
[2023/4/22 14:48:28] Eric Gao: I found out the hard way after wasting an hour trying to make cnn work
[2023/4/22 14:48:51] Sunaya: thanks
[2023/4/22 14:48:57] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/4/22 14:49:13] Sunaya: you say you're welcome
[2023/4/22 14:49:17] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/4/22 14:49:18] Sunaya: not ok
[2023/4/22 14:49:22] Sunaya: good
[2023/4/22 14:58:12] Sunaya: for cnn did you what features did you use
[2023/4/22 15:00:08] Sunaya: also how long does CNN take usually
[2023/4/22 15:12:38] Eric Gao: Just images themselves
[2023/4/22 15:12:48] Eric Gao: Each epoch max 30s
[2023/4/22 15:41:01] Sunaya: random forest gave Accuracy: 54.29%
[2023/4/22 15:41:06] Sunaya: alhumdulillah
[2023/4/22 16:18:08] Sunaya: i looked at my orb features it's all -1
[2023/4/22 16:18:24] Sunaya: so there was something wrong with the fit
[2023/4/22 20:06:52] Sunaya: eric i can't get the CNN to work
[2023/4/22 20:09:45] Sunaya: i was able to fix the random forest and knn but accuracy is so low
[2023/4/22 20:09:55] Sunaya: will probably need CNN but can't make it work :(
[2023/4/22 22:48:05] Sunaya: still can't fix it :(
[2023/4/23 00:01:32] Eric Gao: Did you sleep?
[2023/4/23 01:30:00] Sunaya: huh sleep what is that?
[2023/4/23 04:08:29] Sunaya: Eric are you free

[2023/4/23 08:05:39] Sunaya: so bad tho so so bad
[2023/4/23 08:08:49] Eric Gao: You need to try at least 20 epochs
[2023/4/23 08:09:04] Sunaya: yea i was just doing that to see if it'll work or now
[2023/4/23 08:09:03] Eric Gao: Which takes more than an hour
[2023/4/23 08:09:10] Sunaya: so happy it atleast works

[2023/4/23 08:15:26] Sunaya: or smt
[2023/4/23 08:15:37] Eric Gao: this is for using the model to predict something
[2023/4/23 08:15:44] Sunaya: oh okay
[2023/4/23 08:15:51] Eric Gao: yes, one of them is the accuracy and the other is the score
[2023/4/23 08:15:59] Eric Gao: score or loss
[2023/4/23 08:16:00] Sunaya: what is score?
[2023/4/23 08:16:07] Sunaya: ok loss alrihgt
[2023/4/23 08:16:24] Sunaya: i'll test it on 10 epoch now see what happens

[2023/4/23 13:19:58] Eric Gao: add some dropouts
[2023/4/23 13:20:15] Sunaya: how many
[2023/4/23 13:20:16] Eric Gao: add more conv layers also since your task is more tricky

[2023/4/24 13:46:50] Sunaya: for 2 it's 1/3 and 2/3 right?
[2023/4/24 13:46:54] Sunaya: qn

[2023/9/24 10:39:10] Sunaya: oh okay which part are you on?
[2023/9/24 10:39:22] Eric Gao: finished all the code and proof until 3
[2023/9/24 10:39:24] Eric Gao: just starting 3
[2023/9/24 10:40:57] Sunaya: Damn in  latex too
[2023/9/24 10:41:08] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/9/24 10:41:11] Eric Gao: took too much time
[2023/9/24 10:41:20] Eric Gao: each proof is 2 pages long
[2023/9/24 10:42:20] Sunaya: I see
[2023/9/24 10:42:48] Sunaya: Sheesh you’re fast
[2023/9/24 15:16:37] Sunaya: eric
[2023/9/24 15:16:40] Sunaya: you were right
[2023/9/24 15:16:45] Sunaya: i should've j used overleaf
[2023/9/24 15:17:07] Sunaya: fk latex fk it it's taking me hours and housrs and housr even tho i had basically finished everythign so much earlier
[2023/9/24 15:17:17] Eric Gao: I know
[2023/9/24 15:17:22] Eric Gao: I'm on splitN
[2023/9/24 15:17:29] Eric Gao: been stuck for 30min
[2023/9/24 15:17:32] Sunaya: and look at this
‎[2023/9/24 15:17:35] Sunaya:‎<附件：00003380-PHOTO-2023-09-24-15-17-35.jpg>
[2023/9/24 15:17:36] Sunaya: fking stuck
[2023/9/24 15:17:40] Eric Gao: eww
[2023/9/24 15:17:44] Sunaya: need to fix all the alignment
[2023/9/24 15:18:18] Sunaya: splitN was fun
[2023/9/24 15:18:27] Sunaya: lateX isn't
[2023/9/24 15:21:06] Eric Gao: how did you do splitN
[2023/9/24 15:21:11] Eric Gao: I'm writing a lot of ifs
[2023/9/24 15:21:20] Sunaya: i only have three conditions
[2023/9/24 15:21:45] Eric Gao: yea empty tree, i=0, and else right
[2023/9/24 15:22:32] Eric Gao: my fking brain is not fking working
[2023/9/24 15:23:46] Sunaya: four in total if you count everything 
i pattern match node(l, x, r)  then i check the size(r) with i. three cases arise, equal, greater or less. equal easy case. 
if size(r) greater, you have to split r again
if size(r) smaller, you merge more stuff in r and split the left again but with a different i
[2023/9/24 15:24:05] Eric Gao: yea that's what I mean by writing a bunch of ifs
[2023/9/24 15:24:33] Sunaya: i see
[2023/9/24 15:24:50] Sunaya: i just use real.compare in the case to get equal greater and less
[2023/9/24 15:25:04] Sunaya: makes it more readable but i do a bit of extra stuff that is converting int to float
[2023/9/24 15:25:06] Eric Gao: but isn't size retuning int?
[2023/9/24 15:25:14] Eric Gao: I see
[2023/9/24 15:25:55] Sunaya: where are you stuck in this?
[2023/9/24 15:26:04] Sunaya: what's not working?
[2023/9/24 15:26:33] Eric Gao: I don't know. brain is too tired to focus
[2023/9/24 15:26:49] Eric Gao: I have that idea but I haven't written things out yet
[2023/9/24 15:26:55] Sunaya: i see
[2023/9/24 15:27:26] Sunaya: also for me when i was doing it everything worked but there was a case where if you have a tree of size 4 and i is also 4 it was going in infinite loop
[2023/9/24 15:27:35] Sunaya: so try to use a testcase that's similar to that too
[2023/9/24 15:27:51] Sunaya: it was cause of my merge function so i had to do a little tweaking
[2023/9/24 15:28:22] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/9/24 15:28:24] Eric Gao: thanks
[2023/9/24 15:28:40] Sunaya: how long are you plannign to stay awake?
[2023/9/24 15:29:01] Eric Gao: for 30 more mins I guess
[2023/9/24 15:29:04] Eric Gao: until I finish split
[2023/9/24 15:29:15] Sunaya: i see okay
[2023/9/24 15:29:40] Sunaya: good luck let me know if you're still stuck
[2023/9/24 15:32:03] Eric Gao: mashaallah it's working
[2023/9/24 15:32:07] Sunaya: nice
[2023/9/24 15:32:33] Sunaya: i'm planning to not sleep unitl i fully complete functional
[2023/9/24 15:32:41] Eric Gao: how many questions left for you
[2023/9/24 15:32:52] Sunaya: i've done all it's just i need to type it in latex
[2023/9/24 15:32:57] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/9/24 15:35:59] Eric Gao: fk it's not working
[2023/9/24 15:36:03] Eric Gao: a testcase failed
[2023/9/24 15:36:08] Sunaya: damn

‎[2023/9/24 15:36:27] Sunaya:‎<附件：00003423-PHOTO-2023-09-24-15-36-27.jpg>
[2023/9/24 15:36:34] Sunaya: latex will be my downfall
[2023/9/24 15:36:41] Eric Gao: make function names shorter
[2023/9/24 15:36:53] Sunaya: yea i'll prolly do that
[2023/9/24 15:40:27] Eric Gao: now working
[2023/9/24 15:40:31] Eric Gao: I fked up a base case
[2023/9/24 15:40:35] Sunaya: i see
[2023/9/24 15:40:44] Sunaya: works with this too?
[2023/9/24 15:40:47] Eric Gao: how did you write the testcases tho?
[2023/9/24 15:40:59] Eric Gao: yea, I did d-c-b-a, with no right subtrees
[2023/9/24 15:41:11] Sunaya: by hand
[2023/9/24 15:41:17] Sunaya: i ran with a tree
[2023/9/24 15:41:24] Sunaya: and saw the outcome and sketched it out
[2023/9/24 15:41:35] Sunaya: and used multiple trees
[2023/9/24 15:41:36] Eric Gao: yea but we're supposed to put them in latex
[2023/9/24 15:41:43] Eric Gao: how would you do that
[2023/9/24 15:41:51] Eric Gao: I tried using a let block but it doesn't let me do "in"
[2023/9/24 15:41:56] Sunaya: testcases in lateX?
[2023/9/24 15:42:15] Eric Gao: sorry in sml
[2023/9/24 15:42:52] Sunaya: i dont' get what you mean

[2023/9/24 15:43:55] Eric Gao: I didn't even use a merge function
[2023/9/24 15:44:34] Eric Gao: I just used node to combine subtrees
[2023/9/24 15:45:03] Sunaya: i see yea you can do that too
[2023/9/24 15:45:26] Sunaya: i think i used merge only once, the other time i used node too
[2023/9/24 15:45:37] Sunaya: idk why i used it but there was a readson back then
[2023/9/24 15:45:39] Eric Gao: you probably don't need merge

[2023/9/24 16:28:18] Sunaya: same with span
[2023/9/24 16:33:49] Sunaya: how was your qn 2 2 pages mine is 3 pages long
[2023/9/24 16:34:02] Eric Gao: mine was more than 2 pages
[2023/9/24 16:34:12] Sunaya: i see
[2023/9/24 17:15:39] Eric Gao: done
[2023/9/24 17:15:46] Sunaya: nice
[2023/9/24 17:15:56] Sunaya: you did the bonus too right?
[2023/9/24 17:15:58] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/9/24 17:16:06] Sunaya: how many cases did you have
[2023/9/24 17:16:09] Sunaya: 5 right
[2023/9/24 17:16:25] Sunaya: did you put the whole let block inside or j described in words
[2023/9/24 17:16:28] Eric Gao: 2 cases and 4 cases under inductive case
[2023/9/24 17:16:39] Sunaya: for the inductive case
[2023/9/24 17:16:44] Eric Gao: 4
[2023/9/24 17:16:52] Eric Gao: both empty, one empty, and neither empty
[2023/9/24 17:16:56] Sunaya: did you put the whole let block
[2023/9/24 17:17:11] Eric Gao: I put my code before the proof
[2023/9/24 17:17:23] Sunaya: yea i'll do that and j describe in words
[2023/9/24 17:17:28] Sunaya: or smt similar
[2023/9/24 17:17:30] Eric Gao: in the proof I just said casing on simplify(tl) and simplify(tr) based on the let block
[2023/9/24 17:17:38] Sunaya: i see yea
[2023/9/24 17:17:47] Sunaya: alrgh i'll be done by 1 i think
[2023/9/24 17:17:53] Eric Gao: good
[2023/9/24 17:17:55] Eric Gao: luck
[2023/9/24 17:17:56] Sunaya: and then i need ot make the SI worksheet
[2023/9/24 17:18:03] Eric Gao: damn so much work for you
[2023/9/24 17:18:16] Sunaya: i hate SI it's like homework every week
[2023/9/24 17:18:22] Eric Gao: I'll read through my pdf one last time and submit and go sleep
[2023/9/24 17:18:35] Sunaya: okay good night
[2023/9/24 17:18:40] Eric Gao: good night
[2023/9/24 17:20:17] Eric Gao: too tired to look through the pdf
[2023/9/24 17:20:19] Eric Gao: submitting now
[2023/9/24 17:23:24] Sunaya: damn can't even submit
[2023/9/24 17:24:20] Eric Gao: I submitted. If they blame me for not assigning pages correctly, I'll blame them for not setting up the outline properly
[2023/9/24 18:16:13] Sunaya: do we need to add the code for each quesiton or is it fine if we add it once
[2023/9/25 00:04:58] Eric Gao: I added code for questions that depends on my implementation
[2023/9/25 00:14:45] Sunaya: for the last section the work did you add your code for rebalance for each question
[2023/9/25 00:49:29] Eric Gao: no
[2023/9/25 00:49:37] Eric Gao: maybe I should
[2023/9/25 03:47:57] Sunaya: Eric did you have a lemma for 2.3?
[2023/9/25 03:48:09] Sunaya: I did and I just realized you can prove it without a lemma
[2023/9/25 03:48:24] Sunaya: So much time wasted writing in latex
[2023/9/25 04:09:18] Eric Gao: I don’t remember
‎[2023/9/25 05:24:35] Sunaya:‎<附件：00003527-PHOTO-2023-09-25-05-24-35.jpg>
[2023/9/25 05:24:42] Sunaya: I didn’t realize that it was cotton
[2023/9/25 05:24:54] Sunaya: And it shrank so much doesn’t even fit anymore
[2023/9/25 05:49:48] Eric Gao: God samn
[2023/9/25 05:49:50] Eric Gao: *damn
[2023/9/25 07:40:23] Eric Gao: You wanna order water?
[2023/9/25 08:34:43] Sunaya: Yes
[2023/9/25 08:35:12] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/9/25 08:35:14] Sunaya: I’d you don’t have any I got some
[2023/9/25 08:35:16] Eric Gao: How many you want?
[2023/9/25 08:35:21] Eric Gao: I’m fine for now
[2023/9/25 08:35:27] Sunaya: how many can we get
[2023/9/25 08:35:33] Eric Gao: I got 36 last time
[2023/9/25 08:35:38] Eric Gao: I think 50 is fine
[2023/9/25 08:35:47] Sunaya: ok seems fine
[2023/9/25 08:39:06] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/9/25 08:39:11] Eric Gao: I’m getting 60
[2023/9/25 08:50:45] Sunaya: Alright
[2023/9/25 09:05:58] Eric Gao: Water is here
[2023/9/25 09:10:09] Sunaya: no way so quick?
[2023/9/25 09:10:23] Sunaya: I’m in the toilet wait a sec
[2023/9/25 09:12:28] Eric Gao: Damn I got the wrong size
[2023/9/25 09:12:39] Eric Gao: I got 72 bottles of 500ml
‎[2023/9/25 09:16:45] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00003550-PHOTO-2023-09-25-09-16-45.jpg>
[2023/9/25 09:17:03] Sunaya: Okay thank you how much do I owe you?
‎[2023/9/25 09:17:17] Sunaya:‎<附件：00003552-PHOTO-2023-09-25-09-17-17.jpg>
[2023/9/25 09:17:47] Eric Gao: God damn you poop with doors open
[2023/9/25 09:17:55] Sunaya: I do why not
[2023/9/25 09:17:55] Eric Gao: The bill is on one of the water
[2023/9/25 09:18:10] Sunaya: Okay thanks
[2023/9/25 09:21:28] Eric Gao: Because your room will be stinky
[2023/9/25 09:34:19] Sunaya: My poop smells good all the time
[2023/9/25 09:34:39] Eric Gao: Bring some
[2023/9/25 09:34:56] Sunaya: Send me you QNB QR code I’ll send you the money
[2023/9/25 09:35:06] Sunaya: No cash on me
[2023/9/25 09:35:12] Eric Gao: It’s fine
[2023/9/25 09:35:24] Eric Gao: Next time you but water
[2023/9/25 09:35:35] Sunaya: No j send it
[2023/9/25 09:35:46] Eric Gao: Too lazy
[2023/9/25 09:35:59] Sunaya: Once I have it it’s easy to send money without cash
[2023/9/25 09:36:06] Sunaya: I have khadija too
[2023/9/25 09:36:19] Sunaya: Send it when you’re not lazy
[2023/9/25 09:36:43] Eric Gao: Eh
[2023/9/25 10:15:30] Sunaya: eric did you use lemma for your proof of 2.3?
[2023/9/25 10:16:16] Eric Gao: yea I did
[2023/9/25 10:16:28] Sunaya: it can kinda be proved without a lemma
[2023/9/25 10:16:33] Eric Gao: no
[2023/9/25 10:16:37] Sunaya: really?
[2023/9/25 10:16:56] Eric Gao: The lemma I had is ∀t ∈ treeS, T(convH(t)) ∼=
conv(t)
[2023/9/25 10:17:13] Eric Gao: this depends on totality of convH
[2023/9/25 10:17:19] Sunaya: i had a similar one but there was one more thing
[2023/9/25 10:17:58] Sunaya: this was mine
‎[2023/9/25 10:18:01] Sunaya:‎<附件：00003579-PHOTO-2023-09-25-10-18-01.jpg>
[2023/9/25 10:18:13] Sunaya: and you still have several cases for the main property right
‎[2023/9/25 10:19:05] Sunaya:‎<附件：00003581-PHOTO-2023-09-25-10-19-05.jpg>
‎[2023/9/25 10:19:33] Sunaya:‎<附件：00003582-PHOTO-2023-09-25-10-19-33.jpg>
[2023/9/25 10:19:50] Eric Gao: No because this only works when the tree is not empty
[2023/9/25 10:20:20] Sunaya: hmmm true
[2023/9/25 10:20:29] Sunaya: so you'd say mine is correct toto
[2023/9/25 10:20:39] Eric Gao: I don’t know
[2023/9/25 10:21:08] Sunaya: but you're confident it cannot be solved without a lemma?
[2023/9/25 10:21:31] Sunaya: and that we can't do this  cCan l -> T(cCanH l) and j use IH intantiated to T(cCanH l)
[2023/9/25 10:21:38] Eric Gao: The question says we might need a lemma
[2023/9/25 10:21:47] Sunaya: same that's why i had one too
[2023/9/25 10:21:50] Eric Gao: I’m pretty sure they expect us to have one
[2023/9/25 10:22:17] Eric Gao: I don’t know exactly what you mean
[2023/9/25 10:25:20] Sunaya: IH1 we have: trS l ~ trS(cCan l)
right so since cCan I -> T(cCanH I)
we could basically replace trS I ~ trS(T(cCanH I)) and use that
[2023/9/25 10:25:32] Sunaya: i skipped a lot of steps but do you get what i mean
[2023/9/25 10:25:45] Sunaya: yknow what
[2023/9/25 10:25:59] Sunaya: nvm im not going to change my answer anyway so
[2023/9/25 10:26:07] Sunaya: we j wait until thursday
[2023/9/25 10:26:12] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/9/25 10:26:23] Sunaya: too tired to keep changing it
[2023/9/25 10:27:06] Eric Gao: T
[2023/9/25 11:04:01] Sunaya: did we have an assignment for elevator speech where we had to record a video of ourself?
[2023/9/25 11:04:09] Sunaya: saying the elevator speech?
[2023/9/25 11:04:40] Eric Gao: No
[2023/9/25 11:04:50] Sunaya: i remembered seeing one
[2023/9/25 11:05:00] Eric Gao: I don’t remember
[2023/9/25 11:05:05] Sunaya: ig it was for previous year during COVID
[2023/9/25 11:05:21] Sunaya: did you have your elevator speech?
[2023/9/25 11:14:57] Eric Gao: Not yet
[2023/9/25 11:15:08] Eric Gao: I have a feeling that it’s gonna happen tmr
[2023/9/25 11:15:20] Sunaya: i super fked up hopefully i get like 70-80 percent atleast
[2023/9/25 11:15:31] Sunaya: i thought there was a video one too and wan't too bothered
[2023/9/25 11:15:35] Eric Gao: What happened
[2023/9/25 11:15:38] Sunaya: j realized ther eisn't one
[2023/9/25 11:15:54] Sunaya: he aksed a random question and i didn't know how to answer it and it was so akward
[2023/9/25 11:16:01] Eric Gao: what did he ask?
[2023/9/25 11:16:15] Sunaya: liek he said, i heard you CS people are doing awesome stuff, what have you been upto lately
[2023/9/25 11:16:27] Eric Gao: yea like some projects
[2023/9/25 11:17:08] Sunaya: thing is i didn't know what to say cause my elevator speech had stuff from lalst year and like he was asking what i'm doing rn
[2023/9/25 11:17:17] Sunaya: and i got confused what to say and it was j bad
[2023/9/25 11:17:52] Eric Gao: Damn
[2023/9/25 13:32:56] Sunaya: eric send me your QNB qr code
[2023/9/25 13:33:05] Sunaya: i'm gonna bug you everyday until you send it
[2023/9/25 13:33:34] Eric Gao: try me
[2023/9/25 13:35:26] Sunaya: i will
[2023/9/26 02:54:59] Eric Gao: can you submit the 76270 deliverable today?
[2023/9/26 02:55:02] Eric Gao: thank you!
[2023/9/26 03:25:16] Sunaya: okay
[2023/9/26 03:25:31] Sunaya: No not unless you give me your QR code
[2023/9/26 03:25:54] Eric Gao: I'll ask fatima
[2023/9/26 03:26:02] Sunaya: NO
[2023/9/26 03:26:08] Sunaya: Just give it to me
[2023/9/26 03:29:36] Eric Gao: ok after you submit
[2023/9/26 03:33:07] Sunaya: Alright
[2023/9/27 07:31:56] Sunaya: What are you having for dinner?
[2023/9/27 07:33:25] Eric Gao: There’s an event at Chinese embassy
[2023/9/27 07:33:34] Eric Gao: We’re eating there
[2023/9/27 07:34:27] Sunaya: I see
[2023/9/27 07:34:36] Sunaya: you guys so lucky
[2023/9/27 07:38:24] Eric Gao: Wish there will be a nepali embassy
[2023/9/27 09:54:51] Sunaya: i think there prolly is
[2023/9/27 09:54:59] Sunaya: considering there's so many Nepalis in qatar
[2023/9/27 09:55:19] Eric Gao: true
[2023/9/27 09:55:25] Eric Gao: do they have events?
[2023/9/27 09:55:31] Sunaya: no

[2023/10/1 11:10:32] Sunaya: Eric
[2023/10/1 11:11:16] Sunaya: I talked with the CA systems and he said j blocking and variables should be fine for this lab
[2023/10/1 11:11:39] Sunaya: I don’t have to do my idea of rotatianv the whole thing and stuff even tho it might work
[2023/10/1 11:11:54] Sunaya: Also he said we can declare an int array
[2023/10/1 11:11:59] Sunaya: J not Malloc it
[2023/10/1 11:15:36] Eric Gao: damn
[2023/10/1 11:15:48] Eric Gao: overcomplicated the whole thing way too much
[2023/10/1 11:19:34] Sunaya: True if I am able to fully revise calc 3d today I’ll try to finish the lab
[2023/10/1 11:34:19] Eric Gao: good luck
[2023/10/1 11:34:41] Sunaya: also it’s been so long since we talked or had food together we should go out someday
[2023/10/1 11:35:18] Sunaya: Oh yea know for the social political midterm he said there is one single mcq that’s worth 25 marks
[2023/10/1 11:41:15] Eric Gao: that's true. you should have come to Liang last weekend
[2023/10/1 11:41:28] Eric Gao: in fall break we could
[2023/10/1 11:41:36] Eric Gao: god damn
[2023/10/1 11:52:10] Sunaya: yea but too expensive
[2023/10/1 11:52:20] Sunaya: 300 riyal like wtf that’s so much
[2023/10/1 11:52:48] Sunaya: Plus it was a lot of Chinese ppl and I felt like I wouldn’t fit in
[2023/10/1 11:53:03] Sunaya: Have to
[2023/10/1 13:05:24] Eric Gao: I mean that's true. I don't think it's really worth the price unless you are looking for somewhere fancy
[2023/10/1 13:05:56] Eric Gao: I see. Everyone would speak English except for Lorenzo
[2023/10/1 13:12:16] Sunaya: umm true next time i'll come too let me know
[2023/10/1 13:12:36] Eric Gao: ok

[2023/10/3 11:26:09] Sunaya: We all fucked up
[2023/10/3 11:26:13] Sunaya: Everyone of us
[2023/10/3 11:26:23] Sunaya: didn’t get the multiple choice correct
[2023/10/3 11:26:23] Eric Gao: How?
[2023/10/3 11:26:26] Eric Gao: Wrf
[2023/10/3 11:26:35] Sunaya: He made a confusing an
[2023/10/3 11:26:37] Sunaya: an
[2023/10/3 11:26:40] Sunaya: Qn
[2023/10/3 11:34:23] Eric Gao: What
[2023/10/3 11:34:34] Eric Gao: You said he’s not giving tricky qns
[2023/10/3 11:56:55] Sunaya: he lied
[2023/10/3 11:57:08] Sunaya: I don’t think a single person got it correct
[2023/10/3 11:57:37] Sunaya: Not me not Lorenzo not Haolin not Enoch not tahlah not the Chinese super senior not 10 other ppl
[2023/10/3 11:58:39] Eric Gao: god damn
[2023/10/3 11:58:41] Eric Gao: rip
[2023/10/3 11:58:46] Eric Gao: what's the question?
[2023/10/3 12:42:09] Sunaya: I’ll tell you tomorrow I’m too tired and dead to think
[2023/10/3 12:48:20] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/10/3 23:36:38] Sunaya: for 64 blocking by 8 and then within that 8 block by 4 right and using variables to shift things around
[2023/10/3 23:42:30] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/10/4 03:17:36] Sunaya: how do you use the variables i'm not able to get 64 lower than 194000
[2023/10/4 03:18:49] Eric Gao: I loaded the top half of A and B into cache and put all data from A into B
[2023/10/4 03:19:16] Eric Gao: then I load the bottom half of A and swapped the bottom left of A with top right of B
[2023/10/4 03:19:30] Sunaya: i'm doing somethign similar
[2023/10/4 03:19:32] Eric Gao: then I loaded the bottom of B and put bottom right of A into bottom right of B
[2023/10/4 03:20:25] Sunaya: idk before i did somethign else it was giving 6000 hits with 3000 miss and evict but then used somethign like this and i got more hits like 7000 but then the miss increased too like 4000
[2023/10/4 03:20:50] Eric Gao: is the something else faster?
[2023/10/4 03:20:54] Sunaya: yes
[2023/10/4 03:21:04] Eric Gao: ok try to improve that then
[2023/10/4 03:21:11] Sunaya: but this shoul've been faster
[2023/10/4 03:23:18] Eric Gao: idk
[2023/10/4 03:23:38] Sunaya: i'll walk you through what i did later maybe you'll see where i might have a problem
[2023/10/4 03:23:49] Sunaya: cause it should work
[2023/10/4 03:25:24] Sunaya: this is waht i do too
[2023/10/4 03:25:31] Sunaya: how many variables did you use
[2023/10/4 03:25:33] Sunaya: 8 right?
[2023/10/4 03:29:46] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/10/4 03:34:38] Sunaya: where you at rn?
[2023/10/4 03:40:50] Eric Gao: library
[2023/10/4 03:42:01] Sunaya: Ok
[2023/10/4 03:46:28] Sunaya: Are you free rn? Or like at 10:50 for 10 minutes
[2023/10/4 03:46:50] Eric Gao: sure I'll be in foodcourt in 5min
[2023/10/4 03:47:19] Sunaya: Or where you in lirbrary I’ll be there
[2023/10/4 03:48:15] Sunaya: I see you
[2023/10/4 04:57:45] Sunaya: Went to mo couldn’t fix it
[2023/10/4 05:06:18] Eric Gao: damn
[2023/10/4 15:44:36] Sunaya: eric do you know who submitted the last class dileraverables?
[2023/10/4 15:44:38] Sunaya: for wriging
[2023/10/4 15:45:17] Sunaya: also i finished

[2023/10/11 13:33:06] Eric Gao: But seriously I don’t know if bald looks better than your current haircut
[2023/10/11 13:33:07] Sunaya: All the more reason to do it
[2023/10/11 13:33:32] Eric Gao: Damn
[2023/10/11 13:33:44] Sunaya: nah it’s fine this hair is not my choice but being baldish is my choice and I like making choices for myself

‎[2023/10/11 13:40:46] Sunaya:‎<附件：00003809-PHOTO-2023-10-11-13-40-46.jpg>
[2023/10/11 13:41:00] Sunaya: Like this
[2023/10/11 13:41:10] Eric Gao: Bro I’m not that skilled
[2023/10/11 13:41:23] Sunaya: no you just use the hair clipped
[2023/10/11 13:41:27] Sunaya: The hush and example
[2023/10/11 13:41:28] Eric Gao: I can probably get all the hair to the same length and that’s it
[2023/10/11 13:41:38] Sunaya: Yes this is what I want
[2023/10/11 13:41:43] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/10/11 13:54:51] Eric Gao: I got it
[2023/10/11 13:58:59] Sunaya: Nice

[2023/10/11 14:21:56] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/10/12 03:21:54] Sunaya: I’ll be there at 11:30
[2023/10/12 03:27:09] Eric Gao: I’ll come to you
[2023/10/15 14:54:38] Sunaya: Eric
[2023/10/15 14:54:42] Sunaya: You know what
[2023/10/15 14:54:57] Sunaya: Let’s do the bet I’m fully prepared and I don’t think I’ll use a cheat sheet too
[2023/10/15 14:55:11] Sunaya: so let’s see who gets higher marks
[2023/10/15 14:55:17] Sunaya: Also first time I’m sleeping at 10
[2023/10/15 14:55:25] Sunaya: So about to sleep in 5 mins
[2023/10/15 14:55:54] Eric Gao: Ok good
[2023/10/15 14:55:57] Eric Gao: We bet
[2023/10/15 14:56:04] Eric Gao: No cheatsheets
[2023/10/15 14:56:14] Sunaya: as long as I don’t make a silly mistake I’ll win for sure
[2023/10/15 14:56:21] Eric Gao: Whoever gets lower sucks the higher one’s peepee
[2023/10/15 14:56:31] Eric Gao: Love your confidence. Let’s find out
[2023/10/15 14:57:51] Sunaya: I prolly would’ve used a cheat sheet if I made one but it takes too long and there’s too much to put in so unbothered
[2023/10/15 14:58:03] Eric Gao: True
[2023/10/15 14:58:08] Eric Gao: I just win ok
[2023/10/15 14:58:40] Sunaya: there’s one Qn tho about cache trade offs that I don’t remember
[2023/10/15 14:59:11] Eric Gao: What cache tradeoff
[2023/10/15 14:59:27] Sunaya: what happens if cache size is larger
[2023/10/15 14:59:33] Sunaya: Or what happens if lines are more
[2023/10/15 14:59:39] Eric Gao: Tag bits
[2023/10/15 14:59:41] Sunaya: Or like what’s the trade off of those
[2023/10/15 15:00:03] Eric Gao: The fewer tag bits, the more likely evictions happen
[2023/10/15 15:00:04] Sunaya: more hits but hit time longer
[2023/10/15 15:00:17] Eric Gao: Really? Why
[2023/10/15 15:00:23] Eric Gao: Why longer
[2023/10/15 15:01:18] Sunaya: it’s int the book I think something. Like bigger size of cache would mean more time for it to move from one place to the other
[2023/10/15 15:01:36] Sunaya: These are the stuff I don’t have nailed on me just know little of it
[2023/10/15 15:01:45] Eric Gao: How big can cache become so that the move time becomes so huge
[2023/10/15 15:01:48] Sunaya: I think it in title cache design considerations
[2023/10/15 15:01:51] Eric Gao: It’s more about hardware
[2023/10/15 15:01:52] Eric Gao: Yea
[2023/10/15 15:02:34] Sunaya: yea
[2023/10/15 15:02:41] Sunaya: Anyways I go sleep now
[2023/10/15 15:02:44] Sunaya: Good night
[2023/10/15 15:02:45] Sunaya: Gl
[2023/10/15 15:03:22] Eric Gao: Good night
[2023/10/15 15:03:42] Eric Gao: You better win cuz I don’t want another sucking
[2023/10/15 15:03:59] Sunaya: I’m gonna be extra careful tomorrow
[2023/10/15 15:05:43] Eric Gao: Good
[2023/10/15 15:05:47] Eric Gao: Me too
[2023/10/17 03:11:17] Sunaya: Eric when are you ordering food from Talabat’s?

[2023/10/19 10:25:51] Sunaya: Where you
[2023/10/19 10:26:01] Sunaya: ‎未接语音通话
[2023/10/20 11:45:41] Sunaya: you wanna go swim
[2023/10/20 11:55:44] Eric Gao: Now no
[2023/10/21 13:34:44] Sunaya: fk we need to implement toString too
[2023/10/21 13:34:50] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/10/21 13:34:58] Sunaya: why ddin't they make one for this
[2023/10/21 13:35:15] Eric Gao: this is a simple one because we can use toString fns from sets and hashs
[2023/10/21 13:35:20] Eric Gao: harder ones later
[2023/10/21 13:35:28] Sunaya: i see
[2023/10/21 13:40:20] Sunaya: omg even testing it is fking time consuming
[2023/10/21 13:42:39] Eric Gao: think on the bright side: you lose enough bets with me so that you never become a gambler
[2023/10/21 13:43:24] Sunaya: you can't add a friend who's not a users right?
[2023/10/21 13:43:39] Sunaya: both ahve to be facebook users to be friends
[2023/10/21 13:43:41] Eric Gao: your requires
[2023/10/21 13:44:03] Eric Gao: I required that added friend must already be a user
[2023/10/21 13:44:09] Sunaya: i see
[2023/10/21 13:44:23] Eric Gao: well actually no
[2023/10/21 13:44:49] Eric Gao: if one doesn't exist, it would be added as a user
[2023/10/21 13:44:53] Eric Gao: but don't think like this
[2023/10/21 13:44:55] Sunaya: i'll try to think of it as what would have in actual facebook
[2023/10/21 13:45:06] Sunaya: cause you can't add a user as a friend if he doesn't have a facbook account
[2023/10/21 13:45:10] Eric Gao: never have I ever used facebook
[2023/10/21 13:45:13] Sunaya: lamo

[2023/10/21 15:17:10] Sunaya: i'm not even halfway through facebook
[2023/10/21 15:17:31] Eric Gao: how about extending our bet until today midnight
[2023/10/21 15:18:03] Sunaya: do you really want to extend?
[2023/10/21 15:18:14] Sunaya: you don't wanna cancel it altogether?
[2023/10/21 15:23:44] Eric Gao: one peepee suck
[2023/10/21 15:23:50] Eric Gao: cancelling it makes it 2
[2023/10/21 15:25:04] Sunaya: next time i'm betting if i know i'll win
[2023/10/21 15:33:13] Eric Gao: but that defeats the whole point of betting
[2023/10/21 15:33:17] Eric Gao: we need uncerntainty
[2023/10/21 15:33:38] Eric Gao: I had an estimation of 10%-20% chance that you'll be able to finish
[2023/10/21 15:34:04] Eric Gao: if extended to 00:00, probability goes up to around 30%
[2023/10/21 15:34:20] Eric Gao: -5 * 0.3 + 1*0.7 = -0.8
[2023/10/21 15:34:30] Eric Gao: I'm expected to give you 0.8 peepee sucks
[2023/10/21 15:37:21] Sunaya: i so need an update function
[2023/10/21 15:37:40] Sunaya: that changes the key val pair that'll help so mcuh
[2023/10/21 15:38:05] Sunaya: i'm so tired i just want to sleep
[2023/10/21 15:38:44] Eric Gao: You can just insert a new entry
[2023/10/21 15:38:51] Eric Gao: Or remove then insert
[2023/10/21 15:39:06] Sunaya: yea but i have to reapeat this multiple times
[2023/10/21 15:39:11] Eric Gao: How tho
[2023/10/21 15:39:19] Eric Gao: I only used max 2 times in one function
[2023/10/21 15:39:54] Sunaya: tbh same but i might use it often
[2023/10/21 15:40:01] Sunaya: okok i'll just delete and add

[2023/10/31 08:48:33] Sunaya: Eric how did you do the last and the second last one for iterator cause I’m trying to do what I did with List and it isn’t working at all, do you make use of partitions and mko-countdown?
[2023/10/31 08:48:49] Eric Gao: Yes
[2023/10/31 08:49:04] Sunaya: but mlko count takes lists tho
[2023/10/31 08:49:08] Eric Gao: Using I.map and I.concat
[2023/10/31 08:49:23] Eric Gao: You cannot use functions from part 1
[2023/10/31 08:49:29] Sunaya: also when you partition you need both (a,b)
[2023/10/31 08:49:51] Sunaya: concat of a and b do you do that too
[2023/10/31 08:49:56] Eric Gao: Yes
[2023/10/31 08:50:10] Sunaya: And then you get a a list iterators
[2023/10/31 08:50:49] Sunaya: and then you use mko count on that list iteration?
[2023/10/31 08:52:48] Sunaya: But mko iterator itself return an evaluation iterator
[2023/10/31 08:53:12] Eric Gao: For mko_countdown, I called trees on inp (which gives tree iterators), and map them to the all possible expressions (which gives exp iterator iterators), then you concat and filter out those whose expression evaluates to target
[2023/10/31 08:53:47] Eric Gao: I’m essentially mapping treeToExps on every value (the tree) of the iterator
[2023/10/31 08:54:08] Sunaya: But what about ordered?
[2023/10/31 08:54:55] Eric Gao: You map mko_countdown on all the first half of the partitions of input, and concatenate them
[2023/10/31 08:55:21] Sunaya: damn this was my idea too it I thought there was a better solution
[2023/10/31 08:55:27] Sunaya: where are you rn?
[2023/10/31 08:55:29] Eric Gao: If it works it works
[2023/10/31 08:55:31] Eric Gao: Dorm
[2023/10/31 08:55:40] Sunaya: Already?
[2023/10/31 08:55:46] Sunaya: You didn’t go functional?
‎[2023/10/31 08:55:49] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00003970-PHOTO-2023-10-31-08-55-49.jpg>
[2023/10/31 08:56:04] Eric Gao: Functional finished 10min early
[2023/10/31 08:56:10] Sunaya: Oh
[2023/10/31 08:56:29] Sunaya: Ok I’ll try this and if I have more qns I’ll ask you
[2023/10/31 08:56:34] Eric Gao: Good luck!
[2023/10/31 08:56:44] Sunaya: Fk this hw fr
[2023/10/31 08:57:53] Eric Gao: I think this one is easier than the last one
[2023/10/31 08:58:35] Eric Gao: I would be much quicker if I used cartesian and stuff in part 1
[2023/10/31 08:59:31] Sunaya: do you use skip left and skip right
[2023/10/31 09:01:47] Eric Gao: No
[2023/10/31 09:02:04] Eric Gao: Was it mentioned anywhere in the handout?
[2023/10/31 09:05:33] Sunaya: no but apparently grade scope checks for that
[2023/10/31 09:05:42] Eric Gao: not my issue
[2023/10/31 09:05:43] Sunaya: And the ppl who went to the CA only know about it
[2023/10/31 09:06:07] Eric Gao: why would I lose marks for not doing something I wasn't even told to do
[2023/10/31 09:06:11] Sunaya: I asked Adan how she did it and found out
[2023/10/31 09:07:12] Eric Gao: we have perfect arguments to say we shouldn't lose marks because of this
[2023/10/31 09:09:26] Sunaya: you did this for the last one too?
[2023/10/31 09:10:14] Sunaya: cause it's so long and almost somethign that souldn't be even considered its so not efficient
[2023/10/31 09:11:29] Eric Gao: yea similar thing
[2023/10/31 09:11:37] Eric Gao: is there a more efficient way?
[2023/10/31 09:11:53] Sunaya: nope i spend the whole day today thinking and no
[2023/10/31 09:12:04] Sunaya: unless you use what they call SKIP and idk what that is
[2023/10/31 09:12:13] Eric Gao: as long as you get good marks on gradescope
[2023/10/31 09:12:19] Eric Gao: I lost 1 mark because I didn't have skip
[2023/10/31 09:12:25] Sunaya: ok ig i'll do that too
[2023/10/31 09:12:32] Sunaya: but i hate this
[2023/10/31 09:14:34] Sunaya: i hate that you can't do the homeworks independently and always have to verify stuff with the prof or CA cause the handout is so bad
[2023/10/31 09:18:11] Sunaya: how do you concate two iterators?
[2023/10/31 09:19:21] Sunaya: like idk how to concat these?
‎[2023/10/31 09:19:24] Sunaya:‎<附件：00004000-PHOTO-2023-10-31-09-19-24.jpg>
[2023/10/31 09:19:40] Eric Gao: yes I.concat
[2023/10/31 09:19:51] Sunaya: doesn't work tho?
[2023/10/31 09:20:00] Eric Gao: just put a iterator.iterator inside
[2023/10/31 09:20:38] Eric Gao: concat is not connecting 2 iterators, but converting a iterator.iterator to an iterator
[2023/10/31 09:20:51] Sunaya: how do i make a iterator.iterator tho?
[2023/10/31 09:21:05] Eric Gao: so you get the tree iterator and map treeToExps on it
[2023/10/31 09:21:11] Eric Gao: so each value now becomes an exp iterator
[2023/10/31 09:21:20] Eric Gao: and the whole thing becomes an exp iterator iterator
[2023/10/31 09:21:23] Sunaya: yea i get it but i can't seem to make iterator.iterator
[2023/10/31 09:21:31] Eric Gao: wdym
[2023/10/31 09:22:28] Sunaya: i have part1 and part2 how do i make them iterator.iterator?
‎[2023/10/31 09:22:31] Sunaya:‎<附件：00004012-PHOTO-2023-10-31-09-22-31.jpg>
[2023/10/31 09:23:37] Eric Gao: you call map on partitions L, the function maps the first half of every element of partitions L with mko_countdown
[2023/10/31 09:26:11] Sunaya: ok yea
[2023/10/31 09:26:18] Sunaya: but we only mapped the first part
[2023/10/31 09:26:37] Sunaya: i need to do that to b too right
[2023/10/31 09:26:52] Sunaya: and then i get two iterator.iterator one for a and one for b
[2023/10/31 09:27:12] Sunaya: i can concat a and get iterator and concat b and get iterator for b but how do i join those two?
‎[2023/10/31 09:27:47] Sunaya:‎<附件：00004019-PHOTO-2023-10-31-09-27-47.jpg>
[2023/10/31 09:29:14] Sunaya: cause [1, 2, 3] [([1],[2,3]),([1,2],[3])] and you want each of l of the tuple
[2023/10/31 09:54:28] Eric Gao: hmm now that I think of it I was missing cases
[2023/10/31 09:54:35] Eric Gao: I did not use the b part
[2023/10/31 09:54:51] Eric Gao: so for [1,2,3], all I used was [1], [1,2], and [1,2,3]
[2023/10/31 09:54:54] Sunaya: damn i've been speding hours trying to fix this
[2023/10/31 09:54:58] Eric Gao: I did not use [2,3]
[2023/10/31 09:55:01] Sunaya: and there's no way
[2023/10/31 09:55:04] Eric Gao: but technically [2,3] can be used
[2023/10/31 09:55:16] Sunaya: how do i write concat do you know?
[2023/10/31 09:55:18] Eric Gao: or does that count as out of order?
[2023/10/31 09:55:30] Sunaya: i dont' think so
[2023/10/31 09:55:49] Eric Gao: apparently marks were not deducted for it
[2023/10/31 09:55:57] Sunaya: no way so you only used a?
[2023/10/31 09:56:08] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/10/31 09:56:11] Sunaya: i see
[2023/10/31 09:56:42] Sunaya: also what about mk_count did you only use a as well for that?
[2023/10/31 09:56:48] Sunaya: the last one
[2023/10/31 09:57:16] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/10/31 09:57:42] Sunaya: damn i see ig i'll do the same cause there's no way to do it without that
[2023/10/31 09:57:49] Sunaya: unless you use SKIP which we have no idea about
[2023/10/31 09:57:52] Eric Gao: I think you still can
[2023/10/31 09:58:11] Sunaya: i tried writing a concatTwo but it didn't work
‎[2023/10/31 09:58:15] Sunaya:‎<附件：00004042-PHOTO-2023-10-31-09-58-15.jpg>
[2023/10/31 09:58:28] Sunaya: does this look fine?
[2023/10/31 09:59:15] Eric Gao: fn() => concatTwo((f()), L2)
[2023/10/31 09:59:20] Sunaya: cause i get this?
[2023/10/31 10:00:14] Sunaya: oh yea i can do that
[2023/10/31 10:00:25] Sunaya: i spent all this trying to fix this
[2023/10/31 10:00:36] Sunaya: aight i'll use this to concat it
[2023/10/31 10:00:48] Eric Gao: Gl
[2023/10/31 10:17:28] Sunaya: i finally fixed ordered_countdown
[2023/10/31 10:17:44] Sunaya: now the last one and then i submit
[2023/10/31 10:23:30] Eric Gao: Good
[2023/10/31 10:41:29] Sunaya: the last one is 1 point and you have to do so much work
[2023/10/31 10:41:31] Sunaya: so not worth it
[2023/10/31 10:41:39] Sunaya: like what the hecl
[2023/10/31 10:45:21] Sunaya: also how did you even test iterator functions?
[2023/10/31 10:46:21] Eric Gao: You’re not supposed to test iterator functions
[2023/10/31 10:46:28] Sunaya: oooo nice
[2023/10/31 10:46:30] Eric Gao: They are given already
[2023/10/31 10:46:37] Sunaya: no i mean
[2023/10/31 10:46:41] Sunaya: Kountdown
[2023/10/31 10:46:56] Sunaya: oh wait i do convert to list and test
[2023/10/31 10:46:59] Eric Gao: Yes
[2023/10/31 11:15:20] Sunaya: also there's more things
[2023/10/31 11:27:13] Eric Gao: What more
[2023/10/31 13:51:57] Sunaya: ddid you finish?
[2023/10/31 13:52:04] Sunaya: wrong person
[2023/10/31 13:52:08] Eric Gao: Lol
[2023/11/1 15:05:08] Sunaya: eric
[2023/11/1 15:05:15] Eric Gao: Yes
[2023/11/1 15:05:35] Sunaya: i want to talk wine about  my troubles today
[2023/11/1 15:05:43] Eric Gao: What troubles
[2023/11/1 15:05:46] Sunaya: yknow i spend 4 hours doing nothing
[2023/11/1 15:05:50] Eric Gao: Me too
[2023/11/1 15:05:59] Sunaya: did you do functional lab?
[2023/11/1 15:06:02] Eric Gao: Nope
[2023/11/1 15:06:05] Sunaya: same
[2023/11/1 15:06:15] Sunaya: yknow Lorenzo used 2 grace days too
[2023/11/1 15:06:19] Eric Gao: Wtf
[2023/11/1 15:06:24] Eric Gao: On systems?
[2023/11/1 15:06:38] Sunaya: yes i glimped on his code and everything was wrong
[2023/11/1 15:06:43] Eric Gao: Damn
[2023/11/1 15:06:45] Sunaya: liek he wasa doing stuff not supposed to
[2023/11/1 15:06:50] Sunaya: so i had to help him fix it
[2023/11/1 15:06:51] Eric Gao: He’s tripping so much
[2023/11/1 15:06:59] Sunaya: and then there was haolin had to help him too
[2023/11/1 15:07:10] Eric Gao: Lorenzo had answers no?
[2023/11/1 15:07:20] Sunaya: apparently wrong answers
[2023/11/1 15:07:27] Eric Gao: Skill issue
[2023/11/1 15:07:40] Sunaya: and i spent the whole time looking at their code now i have so much stuff due for myself
[2023/11/1 15:07:49] Eric Gao: Damn
[2023/11/1 15:08:01] Eric Gao: Lorenzo better give his asshole to you
[2023/11/1 15:08:13] Sunaya: yes that's why i can talk shit about him now
[2023/11/1 15:09:02] Eric Gao: I mean you always could
[2023/11/1 15:09:13] Sunaya: and the context was lorezo helped raineri a little on his code too and gave enoch his whole code and eight when Lorenzo was in our dorms rainier was talking shit about him to Zeina and enoch so i told him no one can cause they got help from him too
[2023/11/1 15:09:23] Sunaya: i had to say this to you cause i coudn't keep it in
[2023/11/1 15:09:36] Sunaya: i just needed to talk to someone
[2023/11/1 15:10:01] Eric Gao: Ok got it
[2023/11/1 15:10:04] Eric Gao: Interesting story
[2023/11/1 15:10:20] Eric Gao: So it’s true that lorenzo is your slave now
[2023/11/1 15:10:28] Sunaya: yea also enoch basically had the same problems as Lorenzo cause he used Lorenzo's code but i think enoch fixed it now
[2023/11/1 15:11:13] Sunaya: but the thing i hated was about them talking shit right when lorezno was like right there, talking shit behind his back when he helped you i dont' like
[2023/11/1 15:11:30] Sunaya: or i think it was just rainier but still
[2023/11/1 15:12:00] Sunaya: so i'm just mad today on how much i spend time hleping people and not being able to finish my work and listening about people talking shit
[2023/11/1 15:12:22] Sunaya: and i wanted to tell you all this cause i can't keep it to myself cause i'm super mad
[2023/11/1 15:12:27] Sunaya: anyways thanks for listening
[2023/11/1 15:13:46] Eric Gao: That’s true. I would not talk shit behind someone
[2023/11/1 15:13:55] Sunaya: esp when they helped you
[2023/11/1 15:14:02] Eric Gao: Yes I know
[2023/11/1 15:14:16] Eric Gao: Lorenzo is naughty most of the time but he’s still a good guy
[2023/11/1 15:14:22] Sunaya: also i made lorezno say only good things about me
[2023/11/1 15:14:26] Eric Gao: I see
[2023/11/1 15:14:26] Sunaya: from now on
[2023/11/1 15:14:57] Eric Gao: Let’s see how long it takes before he forgets
[2023/11/1 15:15:07] Sunaya: he prolly will forget by tomorrow
[2023/11/1 15:15:14] Eric Gao: Lol true
[2023/11/1 15:15:53] Eric Gao: What kind of shit were they talking about Lorenzo?
[2023/11/1 15:16:25] Sunaya: idk about they cause i think it was j rainier and i ddin't hear much but it was prolly about the whole hw thing
[2023/11/1 15:16:58] Eric Gao: But he wouldn’t be able to solve it without Lorenzo’s help right?
[2023/11/1 15:17:01] Sunaya: like i came out and Lorenzo was sad and said look rainier is talking shit about me right in front of me, we could hear it cause he was talking in discord in his rome
[2023/11/1 15:17:04] Sunaya: yes
[2023/11/1 15:17:25] Eric Gao: I would be mad too if I were there
[2023/11/1 15:17:28] Sunaya: so i knocked and told him no one has the right to talk shit about him but me
[2023/11/1 15:17:49] Sunaya: and i put that in WhatsApp too and then i though for a sec and realized he'd allow you do so put you in bracket
[2023/11/1 15:17:55] Eric Gao: You did the right thing
[2023/11/1 15:18:02] Eric Gao: Lol thanks
[2023/11/1 15:18:31] Eric Gao: I’m just playing with lorenzo. I usually don’t talk shit about him
[2023/11/1 15:18:40] Eric Gao: Unless he does something just to be naughty
[2023/11/1 15:19:01] Sunaya: yea I mean we kinda have the right to
[2023/11/1 15:19:08] Sunaya: lorezno approved right
[2023/11/1 15:19:11] Eric Gao: Fr
[2023/11/1 15:19:28] Sunaya: anyways thanks i had to tell this to someone
[2023/11/1 15:19:42] Sunaya: and i feel you're the most rational and logical and i like talking to you
[2023/11/1 15:19:45] Eric Gao: You’re welcome. Thanks for telling me
[2023/11/1 15:19:54] Sunaya: feels liek you'd get what i think most the time
[2023/11/1 15:20:12] Eric Gao: I guess yea I get some of then
[2023/11/1 15:20:17] Sunaya: if you want the sukkki sukki now? i can come
[2023/11/1 15:20:22] Eric Gao: NO
[2023/11/1 15:20:36] Eric Gao: I’m gonna do them in front of your family
[2023/11/1 15:20:40] Eric Gao: Or when you get married
[2023/11/1 15:20:49] Sunaya: what if i dont' get married?
[2023/11/1 15:20:56] Eric Gao: Or when you start working somewhere
[2023/11/1 15:21:04] Eric Gao: I’ll do it in front of your boss
[2023/11/1 15:21:42] Sunaya: we'll see maybe the roles will be reversed by the end of our undergrad
[2023/11/1 15:21:49] Sunaya: i still have chances to win
[2023/11/1 15:21:58] Eric Gao: I can just stop making bets
[2023/11/1 15:22:13] Eric Gao: Cuz 4 suckie suckies are good enough for me
[2023/11/1 15:22:36] Sunaya: i'll temp you with more and win
[2023/11/1 15:22:41] Eric Gao: Imagine if you open a company, I’m gonna trade them for 40% of the share
[2023/11/1 15:22:45] Eric Gao: Try me
[2023/11/1 15:23:05] Sunaya: nah 4% is the max you getting!
[2023/11/1 15:25:39] Eric Gao: Negotiable
[2023/11/1 15:25:58] Sunaya: also i'm suprised you're awake
[2023/11/1 15:26:02] Sunaya: what's keeping you up?
[2023/11/1 15:26:09] Eric Gao: I postponed my sleep schedule by 1h
[2023/11/1 15:26:15] Eric Gao: So I sleep at 11 now
[2023/11/1 15:26:23] Sunaya: i see wake up is sitll 7?
[2023/11/1 15:26:29] Eric Gao: Yes
[2023/11/1 15:26:33] Eric Gao: So 8h per day
[2023/11/1 15:26:38] Sunaya: that's nice
[2023/11/1 15:27:02] Eric Gao: Yes
[2023/11/4 13:23:15] Sunaya: you up?
[2023/11/4 13:23:18] Sunaya: how's this?
‎[2023/11/4 13:23:23] Sunaya:‎<附件：00004164-PHOTO-2023-11-04-13-23-23.jpg>
[2023/11/4 13:23:24] Eric Gao: Yea
[2023/11/4 13:23:49] Eric Gao: Why dry skin
[2023/11/4 13:24:02] Sunaya: idk cause i wanted a funny quesiont
[2023/11/4 13:24:06] Sunaya: that is what i found
[2023/11/4 13:24:14] Sunaya: if you got anythign better i'm all ears
[2023/11/4 13:24:22] Eric Gao: I don’t know if that’s funny
[2023/11/4 13:24:28] Eric Gao: I don’t get it
[2023/11/4 13:24:33] Sunaya: damn
[2023/11/4 13:24:38] Sunaya: it's a dad joke
[2023/11/4 13:25:02] Sunaya: yknokw liek what did the penguin have for lunch today? type jokes
[2023/11/4 13:25:10] Eric Gao: Oooo I just realized why it’s a joke
[2023/11/4 13:25:33] Eric Gao: Ok then it’s fine
[2023/11/4 13:26:38] Eric Gao: It feels that the left part and right half are not visually balanced
[2023/11/4 13:26:50] Sunaya: yea but i couldn't do anything
[2023/11/4 13:26:55] Eric Gao: The black person

[2023/11/4 13:27:38] Eric Gao: Not really
[2023/11/4 13:27:58] Sunaya: thing is this doesn't fit
[2023/11/4 13:28:17] Eric Gao: I think one meme is enough
[2023/11/4 13:28:29] Eric Gao: 2 memes confused me
[2023/11/4 13:29:10] Sunaya: same but i didn't have anythign to put in so put taht as buffer
[2023/11/4 13:29:34] Eric Gao: I don’t know either
[2023/11/5 09:57:07] Sunaya: There’s seriously something wrong with my code
[2023/11/5 09:57:20] Sunaya: Cause there’s no way I should be getting that little performance
[2023/11/5 09:57:40] Sunaya: Mohammed fixed his code and he had I think a lot higher per
[2023/11/5 10:06:35] Eric Gao: damn
[2023/11/5 10:06:43] Eric Gao: how are you doing findfit
[2023/11/5 10:08:09] Sunaya: I’ll check once I’m done with the meeting
[2023/11/5 10:08:18] Eric Gao: meeting for what
[2023/11/5 10:37:15] Sunaya: I checked just now I return the first block I find
[2023/11/5 10:41:48] Eric Gao: Yea
[2023/11/5 10:42:01] Eric Gao: It shouldn’t be slow then
[2023/11/5 10:42:26] Eric Gao: Maybe your extendheap or coalesce are slow
[2023/11/5 10:44:54] Sunaya: I did t really change extend heap much
[2023/11/5 10:45:25] Sunaya: the only code that’s a bit different is coalesce but even on that all the functions operate on O 1
[2023/11/5 10:45:49] Eric Gao: Or you think they operate in O1
[2023/11/5 10:46:17] Eric Gao: Read every line and see if they used any expensive operations
[2023/11/5 10:47:43] Sunaya: yea I’m doing that now
[2023/11/5 11:47:39] Sunaya: I made it so that I only loop 50 times and if I don’t find a block in that 50 I extend heap
[2023/11/5 11:47:45] Sunaya: And now I’m getting 80 percent
[2023/11/5 11:53:18] Eric Gao: Good
[2023/11/5 11:53:26] Eric Gao: I made it loop 3 times and got higher
[2023/11/5 12:02:03] Sunaya: know the kilos for this was like 22k
[2023/11/5 12:02:25] Sunaya: And I think I need like 12k for checkpoint so I have some leeway
[2023/11/5 12:03:20] Sunaya: Also idk if it’s cause of the fruits I ate on the morning my stomach s fucked
[2023/11/5 12:06:34] Eric Gao: Mine is fine tho
[2023/11/5 12:32:51] Sunaya: I went full on Nagasaki
[2023/11/5 12:32:56] Sunaya: On the toilet
[2023/11/5 12:32:59] Sunaya: Feels good
[2023/11/5 12:33:02] Eric Gao: damn
[2023/11/5 12:33:03] Eric Gao: proof?
[2023/11/5 12:33:25] Sunaya: Do you actually want it
[2023/11/5 12:33:35] Eric Gao: don't tell me you haven't flushed
[2023/11/5 12:33:39] Eric Gao: it's gross if you haven't
[2023/11/5 12:33:43] Sunaya: ima still pooping

[2023/11/5 12:34:01] Eric Gao: take a picture of your poop with your dick
[2023/11/5 12:34:25] Sunaya: I would but I don’t want my dick to appear in the instagram account
[2023/11/5 12:34:53] Eric Gao: I won't post it to instagram, you have my word
[2023/11/5 12:36:15] Sunaya: nah my dick don’t look good rn
[2023/11/5 12:36:43] Eric Gao: excuses excuses
[2023/11/5 14:04:12] Sunaya: Checkpoint Perf index = 20.0 (util) + 80.0 (thru) = 100.0/100
[2023/11/5 14:06:27] Sunaya: i kinda wish i made that bet earlier
[2023/11/5 22:28:14] Eric Gao: True
[2023/11/5 22:56:58] Sunaya: Idk what happend but my stomach is truly fucked
[2023/11/5 23:40:22] Eric Gao: Wtf did you eat
[2023/11/5 23:41:01] Eric Gao: We ate the same breakfast and lunch
[2023/11/5 23:41:07] Eric Gao: What did you eat for dinner
[2023/11/5 23:43:40] Sunaya: it happened before dinner
[2023/11/5 23:44:02] Eric Gao: How tho

[2023/11/5 23:44:08] Sunaya: no idea
[2023/11/5 23:44:21] Eric Gao: We literally ate the same things
[2023/11/5 23:44:31] Sunaya: True
[2023/11/5 23:44:58] Eric Gao: But I am Chinese so I have a robust stomach
[2023/11/5 23:45:03] Sunaya: Lmao
[2023/11/5 23:45:17] Sunaya: Maybe it’s from the day before

[2023/11/9 04:15:45] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/11/9 04:15:50] Eric Gao: I’m coming
[2023/11/9 04:16:53] Sunaya: coming or coming
[2023/11/9 04:16:57] Sunaya: cuming
[2023/11/10 06:57:58] Sunaya: eric
[2023/11/10 06:58:03] Sunaya: you had food?
[2023/11/10 06:58:07] Sunaya: i AM HUNFRY
[2023/11/10 06:58:10] Sunaya: if you didn't
[2023/11/10 06:58:13] Sunaya: I AM HUNGRY
[2023/11/10 06:58:53] Eric Gao: I had food
[2023/11/10 13:00:06] Sunaya: https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNfrkUrD/
[2023/11/10 13:00:27] Sunaya: It’ll prolly be stuff like this that you learn i mathematical art
[2023/11/10 13:34:24] Eric Gao: Looks fun
[2023/11/11 07:13:04] Eric Gao: How did you decrease the util by removing the footer
[2023/11/11 07:13:13] Eric Gao: *increase
[2023/11/11 07:13:33] Eric Gao: I did segregated list and my throughput increased by like 4k
[2023/11/11 07:13:58] Sunaya: damn
[2023/11/11 07:14:21] Eric Gao: To remove the footer, I added an extra place in header of free blocks indicating whether the previous block is free or not
[2023/11/11 07:14:34] Sunaya: yup that's what i did
[2023/11/11 07:14:47] Eric Gao: How did it increase util tho
[2023/11/11 07:15:04] Eric Gao: For each free block you can store 8 more bytes right?
[2023/11/11 07:15:18] Sunaya: cause before a 32 bit free block could hold at max a payload of size 16 now it holds 24
[2023/11/11 07:15:19] Sunaya: yea
[2023/11/11 07:16:21] Sunaya: you'll need to change the size in malloc for it to take effect
[2023/11/11 07:16:41] Eric Gao: Decrease asize by 8?
[2023/11/11 07:16:53] Eric Gao: Or there’s more to it
[2023/11/11 07:17:01] Sunaya: there's more to it
[2023/11/11 07:17:30] Sunaya: cause i did this at first and alignment wasn't working or something wrong was happening
you'll need to align it properly too
[2023/11/11 07:17:29] Eric Gao: Ok I’ll keep thinking what I missed out
[2023/11/11 07:17:33] Sunaya: okay
[2023/11/11 07:17:56] Sunaya: also you need to change something in realloc too
[2023/11/11 07:20:30] Eric Gao: Ok thank you, I’ll take a look
[2023/11/11 07:20:43] Sunaya: no problem
[2023/11/11 08:03:10] Eric Gao: wait did you remove all the footers or only footers for allocated blocks
[2023/11/11 08:03:24] Sunaya: only for allocated blocks
[2023/11/11 08:03:28] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/11/11 08:04:02] Eric Gao: I still haven't figured out what's wrong
[2023/11/11 08:04:28] Eric Gao: in the alloc function, our asize is the adjusted block size right
[2023/11/11 08:04:38] Eric Gao: so the minimum is 32 bytes
[2023/11/11 08:04:58] Eric Gao: or 24 bytes
[2023/11/11 08:05:13] Eric Gao: if 24 then data might not be aligned
[2023/11/11 08:05:38] Sunaya: yea so i check if size is 24 if it is then assize would be 32 otherwise aling the size + wsize
[2023/11/11 08:06:05] Eric Gao: I was trying to come up with a one liner for this but still couldn't do it
[2023/11/11 08:06:10] Eric Gao: ig i'll use a if
[2023/11/11 08:09:02] Eric Gao: what's wrong with realloc?
[2023/11/11 08:09:13] Eric Gao: I couldn't figure it out
[2023/11/11 08:09:21] Eric Gao: from a high level it looks fine
[2023/11/11 08:09:24] Sunaya: get_payload_size
[2023/11/11 08:09:30] Sunaya: you'll need to change this
[2023/11/11 08:09:43] Eric Gao: oh yea I forgot thanks
[2023/11/11 08:11:11] Eric Gao: dsize to wsize
[2023/11/11 08:11:17] Sunaya: yea
‎[2023/11/11 08:11:40] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00004398-PHOTO-2023-11-11-08-11-40.jpg>
[2023/11/11 08:11:48] Eric Gao: do you know what this means?
[2023/11/11 08:11:51] Eric Gao: alignment issues?
[2023/11/11 08:12:24] Sunaya: i had this when i didn't change this
[2023/11/11 08:12:44] Sunaya: could be that
[2023/11/11 08:13:07] Sunaya: when my alignment was wrong there was alywas a seg fault
[2023/11/11 08:13:20] Eric Gao: hmmm
[2023/11/11 08:15:21] Sunaya: was it working when you didn't change alignment?
[2023/11/11 08:15:28] Eric Gao: it was
[2023/11/11 08:15:34] Sunaya: yea prolly alignment then
[2023/11/11 08:15:43] Eric Gao: true
[2023/11/11 08:42:04] Eric Gao: are you going to volleyball?
[2023/11/11 08:42:22] Eric Gao: I feel a bit sick and I don't really want to go
[2023/11/11 08:42:25] Sunaya: i dont think i will
[2023/11/11 08:57:46] Eric Gao: I think I fixed my bug
[2023/11/11 08:57:57] Eric Gao: I didn't set the prevalloc flag correctly
[2023/11/11 08:58:01] Eric Gao: damn it another bug
[2023/11/11 08:58:20] Sunaya: gl
[2023/11/11 08:58:58] Sunaya: i tried to implement another thing yesterday got bugs and just stopped
[2023/11/11 08:59:22] Sunaya: i'll do systems again after 3d calc exam if i keep getting bugs i'll j submit 80%
[2023/11/11 09:00:06] Sunaya: and after the footer anythign you try to implement only gets harder and harder
[2023/11/11 09:03:23] Eric Gao: yea true
‎[2023/11/11 13:33:56] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00004420-PHOTO-2023-11-11-13-33-56.jpg>
[2023/11/11 13:34:02] Eric Gao: i've been staring at this for 3 hours
[2023/11/11 13:34:49] Eric Gao: I added a free block to the segregated list after I placed something from malloc, and before the next instruction was called, its value got changed
[2023/11/11 13:35:10] Eric Gao: like nothing was written yet
[2023/11/11 13:35:31] Eric Gao: I'm losing my mind
[2023/11/11 13:36:45] Sunaya: i kinda had that problem when i was trying to decrease the free block size too so i just stopped
[2023/11/11 13:37:09] Sunaya: so the next and prev were pointing to some weird address
[2023/11/11 13:38:44] Eric Gao: how tho
[2023/11/11 13:39:03] Eric Gao: nothing should have overwritten them
[2023/11/11 13:39:26] Eric Gao: I manually traced the whole thing like 5 times and I still couldn't figure out what went wrong

[2023/11/12 02:32:30] Eric Gao: malloc requested size of 32, but I returned a block with size 32, in reality I should have returned a block with size 48 to accommodate the header

[2023/11/13 09:12:38] Eric Gao: Uni
[2023/11/13 09:12:40] Eric Gao: Systems
[2023/11/13 09:12:46] Sunaya: i did i was at the back
[2023/11/13 09:12:57] Eric Gao: False
[2023/11/13 09:13:11] Sunaya: prof Khaled said sunaya is sleeping in class
[2023/11/13 09:13:20] Sunaya: and he made you say hello

[2023/11/13 09:13:47] Eric Gao: When did you sit at the back
[2023/11/13 09:13:55] Sunaya: you didn't pay enough attention
[2023/11/13 09:13:59] Sunaya: i was right behind haolin
[2023/11/13 09:14:06] Eric Gao: Ok that explains it
[2023/11/13 09:14:16] Eric Gao: He can perfectly cover you
[2023/11/13 09:14:27] Eric Gao: All of my attention was at prof
[2023/11/13 09:17:57] Sunaya: you sure
[2023/11/13 09:18:17] Eric Gao: Yea
[2023/11/13 15:13:26] Eric Gao: wait why do we even need a doubly linked list?
[2023/11/13 15:13:46] Eric Gao: in what case do we need to go to the previous free block
[2023/11/13 15:22:21] Sunaya: when we want to coalesce with the previous block
[2023/11/13 15:22:36] Eric Gao: we don't need that tho
[2023/11/13 15:22:41] Eric Gao: we could use the footer and header
[2023/11/13 15:23:51] Sunaya: let me think
[2023/11/13 15:24:01] Sunaya: i remember there was a necessasity for that
[2023/11/13 15:24:12] Eric Gao: I can't think of it
[2023/11/13 15:24:48] Eric Gao: oh right when you remove something
[2023/11/13 15:24:55] Sunaya: ik when removing the prev you'd need to loop through the whole thing, i'm trying to think when you'd need to access it to remove it
[2023/11/13 15:25:11] Sunaya: except for merging
[2023/11/13 15:25:12] Eric Gao: yea cuz if there's only pointer to next then you need to go through the whole list
[2023/11/13 15:25:14] Sunaya: oh fk right
[2023/11/13 15:25:27] Sunaya: when you need to remove it from the list and set the pointers
[2023/11/13 15:26:16] Sunaya: only when you need to fix the pointer after removing you'd need to access the prev block
[2023/11/13 15:26:31] Sunaya: yea i think that's the only place
[2023/11/13 15:37:12] Sunaya: you're awake
[2023/11/13 15:37:14] Sunaya: suprisinglt
[2023/11/13 15:38:24] Sunaya: yknow i've been looking at 3d calc and it's kinda easy but like i shoudlnt' know how to do it but i feel like i do and i feel like i'll mess up the exam and i look at the book but then there's nothing to look at i've been going back and forth i shuold just sleep
[2023/11/13 15:40:33] Eric Gao: These days I sleep at 12
[2023/11/13 15:40:38] Sunaya: damn
[2023/11/13 15:41:19] Eric Gao: wtf
[2023/11/13 15:47:37] Eric Gao: I'm almost done with miniblocks
[2023/11/13 15:47:43] Eric Gao: 1 bug to fix I'll leave to tomorrow
[2023/11/13 15:47:53] Sunaya: oh damn
[2023/11/13 15:48:19] Eric Gao: either data structure is taking up too much memory or somewhere I did not put miniblock flags correctly
[2023/11/13 15:48:34] Sunaya: oh so it runs?
[2023/11/13 15:48:43] Sunaya: what's your util?
[2023/11/13 15:49:44] Eric Gao: No
[2023/11/13 15:50:02] Eric Gao: Segfault because I wrote stuff where they shouldn’t occur
[2023/11/13 15:50:29] Eric Gao: I wrote a printheap and print seglist function so I know exactly where what went wrong
[2023/11/13 15:51:04] Sunaya: oh damn
[2023/11/13 15:51:18] Sunaya: but the whole thing will print too much no?
[2023/11/13 15:51:33] Sunaya: how do you control how much it prints or did you create specific test cases too
[2023/11/13 15:52:53] Eric Gao: So I run mdriver
[2023/11/13 15:53:03] Eric Gao: With -V so I know which file segfaulted
[2023/11/13 15:53:07] Eric Gao: And then I enable debug
[2023/11/13 15:53:22] Eric Gao: I formatted the prints so they look nice
[2023/11/13 15:53:35] Eric Gao: They won’t be really long
[2023/11/13 15:54:01] Sunaya: still doesnt solve too  much stuff being printed tho cause there'll be so much you won't be able to scroll to the top
[2023/11/13 15:54:12] Eric Gao: Well not really
[2023/11/13 15:54:22] Sunaya: i kinda wanted to write my own test cases i might try that
[2023/11/13 15:54:22] Eric Gao: I only print before and after malloc and free
[2023/11/13 15:54:46] Eric Gao: I also print the values out, so if something goes wrong I can easily catch them
[2023/11/13 15:54:54] Eric Gao: Cuz usually they become very weird
[2023/11/13 15:55:14] Eric Gao: I have only segfaulted on short
[2023/11/13 15:55:33] Eric Gao: Long ones went smooth once I finished debugging bugs from short
[2023/11/13 15:55:51] Sunaya: i see
[2023/11/13 15:56:07] Sunaya: i wanna start working on malloc too
[2023/11/13 15:56:15] Sunaya: i'll start from tomorrow once i'm done with 3d calc
[2023/11/13 15:57:26] Eric Gao: Good
[2023/11/13 16:00:28] Sunaya: you think i'll be able to implement mini blocks by tomorrow?
[2023/11/13 23:02:10] Eric Gao: Maybe
[2023/11/14 05:32:21] Eric Gao: Food here?
[2023/11/14 05:32:38] Sunaya: Yes
[2023/11/14 05:32:45] Eric Gao: I’m coming in 5-10min

[2023/11/21 13:55:13] Eric Gao: I have tried 3-4 times to learn drawing before and it never worked
[2023/11/21 13:55:52] Sunaya: tomorrow show me all your drawings and when are you free tomororw i want to see you draw from start to end to see how you think while you draw
[2023/11/21 13:56:04] Sunaya: or when you draw next let me know
[2023/11/21 13:56:07] Eric Gao: I have just that one drawing
[2023/11/21 13:56:14] Sunaya: tbh drawing is a hard hard skill
[2023/11/21 13:56:27] Sunaya: like super hard
[2023/11/21 13:56:35] Sunaya: so it's understandable
[2023/11/21 13:56:50] Sunaya: but yes we draw, ooooo drawing partners
‎[2023/11/21 13:56:53] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00004674-PHOTO-2023-11-21-13-56-53.jpg>
[2023/11/21 13:56:56] Eric Gao: this is the only one I drew
[2023/11/21 13:57:30] Sunaya: this is so good tho for your first proper drawing
[2023/11/21 13:57:46] Eric Gao: this took me a month
[2023/11/21 13:57:51] Sunaya: even i don't have any that's that well drawn, i just have  a mess that looks like a fully drawn picture
[2023/11/21 13:58:08] Sunaya: i admire your patience, i never had the patience to complete my drawings
[2023/11/21 13:58:13] Sunaya: i think we'll go well together
[2023/11/21 13:58:21] Eric Gao: makes sense
[2023/11/21 13:58:24] Sunaya: alight its settled then drawing partners from now
[2023/11/21 13:58:28] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/11/21 13:58:54] Sunaya: i think with a good teacher like me you might be the next Picasso
[2023/11/21 13:59:30] Eric Gao: Might
[2023/11/21 13:59:34] Sunaya: also i've your signature now
‎[2023/11/21 13:59:36] Sunaya:‎<附件：00004687-PHOTO-2023-11-21-13-59-36.jpg>
[2023/11/21 13:59:54] Eric Gao: Too low a resolution
[2023/11/21 14:00:22] Sunaya: it's good enough for fraud
[2023/11/21 14:00:35] Eric Gao: I never sign any legal documents in eric g
[2023/11/21 14:00:45] Sunaya: until today
[2023/11/21 14:00:58] Sunaya: youll be seeing a lot of eric g documents from now on
[2023/11/21 14:01:07] Eric Gao: It’s not even me
[2023/11/21 14:01:12] Eric Gao: I’m Jingxiang
[2023/11/21 14:01:26] Sunaya: hi Jingxiang

[2023/11/21 23:02:39] Eric Gao: Ok thank you
‎[2023/11/23 12:34:09] Sunaya:‎<附件：00004698-PHOTO-2023-11-23-12-34-09.jpg>
[2023/11/23 12:34:20] Sunaya: wanna tag team
[2023/11/23 12:34:33] Sunaya: friend needs help with pain
[2023/11/23 12:34:58] Eric Gao: damn
[2023/11/23 12:35:18] Eric Gao: we can call Lorenzo and play doubles
[2023/11/23 12:35:22] Sunaya: The movie was so good
[2023/11/23 12:35:29] Sunaya: you should’ve come man
[2023/11/23 12:35:31] Sunaya: :(
[2023/11/23 12:35:41] Sunaya: next time im def taking you with me
[2023/11/23 12:36:21] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/11/23 12:36:39] Sunaya: why didn’t you come tho :(
[2023/11/23 12:38:26] Eric Gao: I did
[2023/11/23 15:21:34] Sunaya: ok Eric I’ve decided
[2023/11/23 15:26:00] Sunaya: I’m not helping ppl by looking at my code again
[2023/11/23 15:27:53] Sunaya: cause I helped someone and I was a bit busy so I told them to look over my code and they literally copied everything even the variables to the T
[2023/11/23 15:28:02] Sunaya: And nearly submitted until I saw it
[2023/11/23 15:28:20] Sunaya: So then I told them to change it and very hesitantly they sorta did
[2023/11/23 15:28:37] Sunaya: But then I had to fix their whole previous code j so they wouldn’t submit my same code
[2023/11/23 15:28:52] Sunaya: And the worst part is I didn’t even realize that he sent his friend my code too
[2023/11/23 15:28:58] Sunaya: omg k am so angry
[2023/11/23 15:29:13] Sunaya: now I haven’t slept cause I’m waiting for him to submit without my code in it
[2023/11/23 15:47:03] Sunaya: fuck he finally submitted and its so similar to my code
[2023/11/23 15:53:51] Sunaya: Ugh and the other person prolly has the same code too
[2023/11/23 15:54:27] Sunaya: can you guess the person and the other person?
[2023/11/23 15:56:22] Sunaya: And the thing is near the deadline ppl get so desperate they resort to anything
[2023/11/23 15:58:14] Sunaya: but now I’ve learned my lesson and now I know how much to give to someone
[2023/11/23 15:58:24] Sunaya: its honestly my fault
[2023/11/23 15:58:33] Sunaya: anyways now I finally sleep
[2023/11/23 23:35:15] Eric Gao: God damn
[2023/11/23 23:36:28] Eric Gao: I know it’s not lorenzo this time, so maybe ganni or aditya?
[2023/11/23 23:37:42] Eric Gao: But yea you’re right about not sending your code
[2023/11/23 23:38:24] Eric Gao: I’ve already warned someone that if they ever ask for my code again I’ll screenshot the conversation and report them
[2023/11/24 00:41:56] Sunaya: Nope
[2023/11/24 00:49:57] Eric Gao: who is it then
[2023/11/24 00:50:06] Sunaya: rainier
[2023/11/24 00:50:10] Eric Gao: wtf
[2023/11/24 00:50:19] Sunaya: and then rainier sent it to Enoch
[2023/11/24 00:51:21] Eric Gao: damn
[2023/11/24 00:51:27] Sunaya: he wasn’t using the parser at all at first and I was using the parser for everything and he changed the whole code to use parser and all the variables and everything. The exact same
[2023/11/24 00:51:49] Sunaya: and I saw it and I was like I think you should least change those or maybe we can fix your old code
[2023/11/24 00:52:12] Sunaya: And then he pulled out his WhatsApp and copied the code that he sent to Enoch
[2023/11/24 00:52:19] Sunaya: And there I saw my code too
[2023/11/24 00:52:26] Sunaya: I was like wtf is happening
[2023/11/24 00:53:09] Sunaya: also rainier got 0 at the end
[2023/11/24 00:53:19] Eric Gao: what happened
[2023/11/24 00:53:28] Eric Gao: didn't he has all your code
[2023/11/24 00:53:37] Sunaya: cause it works locally and works on autolabe but gives 0
[2023/11/24 00:53:46] Eric Gao: huh why
[2023/11/24 00:54:05] Sunaya: The first 4 submission was his own code that I fixed and the last one was my code cause he got desperate and that still gave zero
[2023/11/24 00:54:32] Sunaya: At the end it said makefile error or smt
[2023/11/24 00:54:38] Eric Gao: oh interesting
[2023/11/24 00:54:42] Sunaya: but everything ran on autograder
[2023/11/24 00:54:46] Sunaya: J the score was zero
[2023/11/24 00:55:02] Sunaya: Also Enoch again didn’t get full!
[2023/11/24 00:55:22] Eric Gao: dam
[2023/11/24 00:55:34] Sunaya: the bottom two on the leaderboard Rainer and enoch
[2023/11/24 00:55:47] Sunaya: But
[2023/11/24 00:55:59] Sunaya: I really didn’t expect this from them so now I’m not going to charge my code
[2023/11/24 00:56:06] Sunaya: I’ll help by just speaking
[2023/11/24 00:56:19] Sunaya: And saying how I did it but not showing the code
[2023/11/24 00:56:29] Sunaya: Or looking at my code to fix their bug
[2023/11/24 00:56:54] Sunaya: cause then when I tried to look at my code we went line by line to find the bug and he just started to change his code to match mine
[2023/11/24 00:57:05] Eric Gao: yea I agree
[2023/11/24 00:57:11] Eric Gao: last time this happened with Lorenzo and malloc
[2023/11/24 00:57:17] Eric Gao: he ended up taking all of my code
[2023/11/24 00:58:03] Sunaya: Yea the only thing I liked about Lorenzo was even if he copied the code he’s at least bother to change it up a little so the autofrader wouldn’t figure out
[2023/11/24 00:58:11] Eric Gao: true
[2023/11/24 00:58:33] Sunaya: Rainier had the same variable name the same function names the same indentation you’d know it was copied from first glance
[2023/11/24 00:58:59] Sunaya: like idk how someone isn’t scared of copying and having the exact thing
[2023/11/24 00:59:40] Eric Gao: wtf
[2023/11/24 00:59:49] Eric Gao: bro is too desperate
[2023/11/24 01:00:05] Eric Gao: just don't help anyone like 3 hours before the deadline
[2023/11/24 01:00:07] Sunaya: and his initial code he didn’t even use the parser library and the next time his whole code changed and used everything I did and two submissions with two completely different implementation
[2023/11/24 01:00:13] Eric Gao: when people are desperate they do crazy stuff
[2023/11/24 01:00:35] Sunaya: true true yea
[2023/11/24 01:00:59] Sunaya: but the whole experience was  so bad and I was there and I couldn’t do anything
[2023/11/24 01:01:21] Sunaya: at least Haolin wasn’t able to complete but never once asked to look at my code
[2023/11/24 01:02:14] Sunaya: he got a zero and I wish I helped him more cause the whole time o had to keep an eye on rainier just so he wouldn’t send my exact code to autograder
[2023/11/24 01:02:38] Eric Gao: Yea I know
[2023/11/24 01:02:49] Sunaya: also wtf Enoch
[2023/11/24 01:02:52] Eric Gao: No one likes to help people that don’t have appreciation
[2023/11/24 01:03:09] Sunaya: yknow Lorenzo send his whole shell lab code to Enoch
[2023/11/24 01:03:14] Sunaya: And now this too
[2023/11/24 01:03:22] Eric Gao: Enoch is now the new lorenzo
[2023/11/24 01:03:51] Sunaya: but I’m losing hope with every lab like there’s very few ppl that do their own lab
[2023/11/24 01:04:00] Eric Gao: True
[2023/11/24 01:04:37] Sunaya: Anyways I’ve decided I’m not helping anyone with the next proxy thing I’ll just give general idea but never even show my code
[2023/11/24 01:04:42] Eric Gao: Like what’s even the point of doing them if people are not doing on their own
[2023/11/24 01:04:49] Eric Gao: Good idea
[2023/11/24 01:05:30] Sunaya: exactly it’s gotten too bad I feel like
[2023/11/24 01:05:54] Eric Gao: It’s their loss
[2023/11/24 01:06:13] Eric Gao: They will not be able to make it through everything else if they do this now
[2023/11/24 01:06:33] Sunaya: debatable considering Dimitri
[2023/11/24 01:07:06] Sunaya: he’s j like Lorenzo but so far doing well
[2023/11/24 01:07:23] Eric Gao: True
[2023/11/24 01:07:35] Eric Gao: But exceptions don’t happen all the time
[2023/11/24 01:07:49] Eric Gao: At least demetre is more handsome than Lorenzo
[2023/11/24 01:07:56] Eric Gao: And demetre looks normal
[2023/11/24 01:08:03] Sunaya: he’s got a wife too
[2023/11/24 01:08:12] Eric Gao: Lorenzo looks crooked
[2023/11/24 01:08:54] Sunaya: are you going volleyball Saturday?
[2023/11/24 01:09:47] Eric Gao: Prob not
[2023/11/24 01:09:52] Sunaya: Same
[2023/11/24 01:09:52] Eric Gao: Depends on what hammoud wants
[2023/11/24 01:09:59] Sunaya: oh shoot right
[2023/11/24 01:10:03] Sunaya: You’ve got that too
[2023/11/24 01:41:18] Sunaya: You had food?

[2023/11/24 03:04:14] Sunaya: Or fast food
[2023/11/24 03:04:22] Eric Gao: with or without fast food
[2023/11/24 03:04:28] Sunaya: No fast food
[2023/11/24 03:04:44] Sunaya: Cause I haven’t had proper food for days
[2023/11/24 03:04:52] Sunaya: Only tiny bits of fast food
[2023/11/24 03:06:04] Sunaya: Get a different thing from tofu house

[2023/11/24 03:06:16] Sunaya: The is that
[2023/11/24 03:06:30] Sunaya: Cause I can’t think any fulfilling stuff
[2023/11/24 03:07:00] Eric Gao: look at the menu
[2023/11/24 03:07:13] Eric Gao: if you don't find anything we order tofu hosue
[2023/11/24 03:08:36] Sunaya: Platter meal looks good but I don’t like there nothing to mix the rice with
[2023/11/24 03:08:49] Eric Gao: ok tofu house then

[2023/11/25 11:09:32] Sunaya: this could be caching issue
[2023/11/25 11:09:38] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/11/25 11:09:47] Sunaya: By this could be thread issue
[2023/11/25 11:10:15] Eric Gao: I just created a thread in the main loop and did thread detach in the serve function
[2023/11/25 11:10:31] Eric Gao: also moved close connfd to end of serve
[2023/11/25 11:10:36] Sunaya: You haven’t implemented caching?
[2023/11/25 11:10:40] Eric Gao: no
[2023/11/25 11:10:43] Eric Gao: I just started like 5min ago
[2023/11/25 11:10:51] Sunaya: oh yea it’s a thread issue then
[2023/11/25 11:11:12] Sunaya: hmm seems about correct
[2023/11/25 11:12:11] Sunaya: I copied whatever was in the book and it worked
[2023/11/25 11:12:18] Sunaya: Copied it exactly from the book
[2023/11/25 11:12:22] Eric Gao: ok I'll check the book
[2023/11/25 11:12:23] Eric Gao: thanks
[2023/11/25 11:12:37] Sunaya: Oh I think I might know the problem did you malloc
[2023/11/25 11:12:40] Sunaya: conned
[2023/11/25 11:12:43] Sunaya: connfd
[2023/11/25 11:12:43] Eric Gao: no
[2023/11/25 11:12:53] Sunaya: yea you need to it’s in the book
[2023/11/25 11:12:57] Eric Gao: ok I think i forgot
[2023/11/25 11:35:16] Eric Gao: I still have the same thing
[2023/11/25 11:35:25] Eric Gao: I'll go ask the ca tmr
[2023/11/25 11:36:03] Sunaya: and this is only threads right no caching?
[2023/11/25 11:36:07] Eric Gao: yes
[2023/11/25 11:36:10] Sunaya: and you did what they did in the book?
‎[2023/11/25 11:36:34] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00004923-PHOTO-2023-11-25-11-36-34.jpg>
[2023/11/25 11:36:36] Sunaya: on which trace does it start failing?
[2023/11/25 11:36:51] Eric Gao: the same ones with the same errors
[2023/11/25 11:37:08] Sunaya: i did this exact thing only that echo is changed to serve
[2023/11/25 11:37:16] Eric Gao: yes
[2023/11/25 11:37:35] Sunaya: hmmm you didn't change anything anywhere else right?
[2023/11/25 11:37:40] Eric Gao: nope
[2023/11/25 11:37:52] Eric Gao: but this test was failing at checkpoint when I didn't run with check
[2023/11/25 11:37:54] Sunaya: what does it tell you when you run that single trace
‎[2023/11/25 11:38:09] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00004932-PHOTO-2023-11-25-11-38-09.jpg>

[2023/11/25 11:39:56] Sunaya: but this is weird

[2023/11/25 11:41:15] Sunaya: they tell you in the handout use readnb instead
[2023/11/25 11:41:20] Sunaya: under hints
[2023/11/25 11:41:30] Eric Gao: god damn I didn't read it
[2023/11/25 11:41:36] Eric Gao: ok I'll change thanks
[2023/11/25 11:41:44] Sunaya: but i'm suprised it worked in checkpoint
[2023/11/25 11:43:25] Eric Gao: yea ig
[2023/11/25 11:47:35] Sunaya: i'll start looking at my code again after 9 if i'm not able to fix it by 11 i think i'll j leave it at that
[2023/11/25 11:47:45] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/11/25 11:56:59] Eric Gao: ok I fixed mine
[2023/11/25 11:57:06] Eric Gao: it was the issue
[2023/11/25 11:57:11] Sunaya: i see
[2023/11/25 11:57:22] Eric Gao: I might not even start trying cache
[2023/11/25 11:57:25] Eric Gao: I feel too lazy
[2023/11/25 11:57:42] Sunaya: its so much work and then you have to handle synchronization too
[2023/11/25 11:57:47] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/11/25 12:00:12] Sunaya: do you know so far everyone's code i've looked at used readline
[2023/11/25 12:00:52] Eric Gao: dam
[2023/11/25 12:00:57] Sunaya: and it worked for everyone so i though that was fine tooguess they have stronger test for the final thing
[2023/11/25 12:01:07] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/11/25 12:01:16] Eric Gao: at first I accidentally run without the check flag and it failed
[2023/11/25 12:01:43] Sunaya: mine failed everythign without the check flag
[2023/11/25 12:01:55] Eric Gao: lol
[2023/11/25 12:01:56] Sunaya: and then i realized can't use bamboo shark anymore
[2023/11/25 12:02:02] Sunaya: dones't work for the final thing
[2023/11/25 12:02:08] Eric Gao: interseting
[2023/11/25 12:02:19] Eric Gao: my code doesn't run on bamboo
[2023/11/25 12:02:26] Sunaya: proxy-ref doesn't work on bamboo too
[2023/11/25 12:02:37] Sunaya: it's weird check for me works
[2023/11/25 12:02:55] Sunaya: evne the pygress thign works it's only driver.pl
[2023/11/25 12:03:37] Eric Gao: I am so confused about how this even works
[2023/11/25 12:03:41] Eric Gao: the whole testing stuff
[2023/11/25 12:03:48] Eric Gao: I just blindly run the driver.sh
[2023/11/25 12:04:10] Eric Gao: also my code now passes all cases except cache
[2023/11/25 12:04:12] Sunaya: no way you haven't run it locally? using two terminals
[2023/11/25 12:04:19] Eric Gao: I never tried
[2023/11/25 12:04:24] Eric Gao: too lazy
[2023/11/25 12:04:26] Sunaya: damn tbh it's not worth it
[2023/11/25 12:04:40] Eric Gao: it's only giving me like 70%
[2023/11/25 12:04:45] Eric Gao: ig I'll do something with cache
[2023/11/25 12:05:56] Sunaya: yea i think cache is liek 32 marks
[2023/11/25 13:28:07] Sunaya: this lab is just so weird
[2023/11/25 13:32:36] Eric Gao: It is
[2023/11/25 13:32:59] Eric Gao: When we interviewed prof khaled, he said this was the most fun for him, then it’s shell lab
[2023/11/25 13:37:54] Sunaya: nah it’s j something im doing weirdly that making this whole thing word
[2023/11/25 14:24:05] Sunaya: i shoul've j used permutation and combination to fix my issue
[2023/11/25 14:24:14] Sunaya: shou'dve done that way earlier
[2023/11/25 14:24:22] Sunaya: cause that fixed it
[2023/11/25 14:24:26] Sunaya: that and a bit of thinking
[2023/11/25 23:01:47] Eric Gao: Interesting
[2023/11/26 08:00:17] Eric Gao: my strcpy was wrong
[2023/11/26 08:04:21] Eric Gao: Now I have 90%
[2023/11/26 08:04:33] Eric Gao: Some issues with my file sizes
[2023/11/26 08:37:45] Sunaya: oh nice
[2023/11/26 08:59:50] Sunaya: Eric
[2023/11/26 08:59:54] Sunaya: Are you on campus?
[2023/11/26 09:01:18] Sunaya: Did you use reference count?
[2023/11/26 09:01:33] Eric Gao: Not on campus
[2023/11/26 09:01:35] Eric Gao: No count
‎[2023/11/26 09:13:23] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00004996-PHOTO-2023-11-26-09-13-23.jpg>
[2023/11/26 09:13:24] Eric Gao: I have these left
[2023/11/26 09:14:24] Sunaya: oh nice
[2023/11/26 09:52:43] Eric Gao: done
‎[2023/11/26 09:52:43] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00005000-PHOTO-2023-11-26-09-52-43.jpg>
[2023/11/26 09:52:57] Eric Gao: I'll fix the style and submit later
[2023/11/26 09:53:05] Eric Gao: I feel like I would spend more time fixing the style than my bugs
[2023/11/26 10:03:31] Sunaya: And you still ddidng use reference counts
[2023/11/26 10:26:54] Eric Gao: no reference counts
‎[2023/11/26 11:24:04] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00005005-PHOTO-2023-11-26-11-24-04.jpg>
[2023/11/26 11:24:05] Eric Gao: fuck this shit man
[2023/11/26 11:25:41] Eric Gao: did you also fail D12-many-blocks2.cmd
[2023/11/26 11:32:06] Sunaya: nope a different one
[2023/11/26 11:32:16] Eric Gao: shit man
[2023/11/26 11:32:47] Eric Gao: which one did you fail
[2023/11/26 11:34:20] Sunaya: I think k it was lru2
[2023/11/26 11:35:40] Eric Gao: interesting
[2023/11/26 11:35:54] Sunaya: could be a race condition that we have
[2023/11/26 11:36:02] Eric Gao: why would it be race condition
[2023/11/26 11:36:10] Eric Gao: I think it might have to do with when we evict
[2023/11/26 11:36:24] Eric Gao: cuz in the test I failed they used 1000k data
[2023/11/26 11:36:26] Sunaya: yea but that’s cause of the race I believe
[2023/11/26 11:36:32] Eric Gao: which should have filled my cache
[2023/11/26 11:36:42] Eric Gao: what did you have as a condition for when you evict?
[2023/11/26 11:37:04] Eric Gao: I did while (object_size + C->cache_size > MAX_CACHE_SIZE)
[2023/11/26 11:37:19] Sunaya: Yea
[2023/11/26 11:37:36] Sunaya: And I have a loop to keep envicting until I can fit that new block
[2023/11/26 11:37:43] Eric Gao: yea
[2023/11/26 11:37:46] Sunaya: Which is less than or equal to max block size
[2023/11/26 11:37:53] Eric Gao: yes
[2023/11/26 11:38:15] Eric Gao: ok then probably race then
[2023/11/26 11:38:16] Sunaya: try to run your code with 500 iterations the tests
[2023/11/26 11:38:19] Sunaya: yea
[2023/11/26 11:38:26] Eric Gao: eh too much work
[2023/11/26 11:38:28] Eric Gao: I'll go to CA
[2023/11/26 11:38:33] Sunaya: are you going to fix it or
[2023/11/26 11:38:41] Sunaya: J leave it at that
[2023/11/26 11:38:43] Eric Gao: if CA knows what's wrong I'll fix it
[2023/11/26 11:39:10] Eric Gao: hby
[2023/11/26 11:39:51] Sunaya: no idea I’ll keep submitting until I get full ig and then depending on how I feel might go ca
[2023/11/26 11:39:55] Eric Gao: did you find anything with this?
[2023/11/26 11:40:05] Sunaya: I haven’t run it myself
[2023/11/26 11:40:35] Sunaya: and the handout talks about  this
[2023/11/26 11:40:43] Eric Gao: yea it does
[2023/11/26 11:40:49] Eric Gao: but it doesn't force us right
[2023/11/26 11:40:52] Sunaya: But idk what the idea is so I just didn’t use it
[2023/11/26 11:40:55] Sunaya: yea
[2023/11/26 11:41:42] Sunaya: And it’s not in the book properly
[2023/11/26 11:42:06] Eric Gao: we used it in cachelab
[2023/11/26 11:42:33] Eric Gao: but I still feel like a doubly linked list with an implicit LRU count is better
[2023/11/26 11:43:21] Sunaya: Huh we didn’t?
[2023/11/26 11:43:59] Eric Gao: I feel like we did
[2023/11/26 11:44:01] Eric Gao: or at least I did
[2023/11/26 11:44:12] Eric Gao: I just submitted again and now it's another test that failed
[2023/11/26 11:44:26] Sunaya: one or two
[2023/11/26 11:44:37] Eric Gao: one still
[2023/11/26 11:44:43] Eric Gao: I'll submit again
[2023/11/26 11:44:45] Sunaya: That’s good
[2023/11/26 11:44:54] Sunaya: Yea keep doing that I think you’ll prolly get full
[2023/11/26 11:45:05] Eric Gao: you too
[2023/11/26 11:45:16] Eric Gao: let's see how many tries before we get full
[2023/11/26 11:46:10] Sunaya: Wanna bet?
[2023/11/26 11:46:35] Eric Gao: interesting
[2023/11/26 11:47:24] Eric Gao: now I have 2 tests failed
[2023/11/26 11:47:27] Eric Gao: 2 different ones

[2023/11/26 11:47:47] Eric Gao: from whre
[2023/11/26 11:47:51] Sunaya: from satkar restaurant
[2023/11/26 11:47:57] Sunaya: get the buff one 15 riyal
[2023/11/26 11:48:01] Eric Gao: ok I'll try next time
[2023/11/26 11:48:21] Sunaya: Maybe that’s why they gave infinite submissions
[2023/11/26 11:48:30] Eric Gao: Probably
[2023/11/26 11:48:36] Eric Gao: Or they forgot to set a limit
[2023/11/26 11:49:34] Sunaya: there’s nothing in the handout too
[2023/11/26 11:49:40] Sunaya: I checked twice to make sure
[2023/11/26 11:49:42] Eric Gao: True
[2023/11/26 11:50:03] Sunaya: The momo is actually better than the ones in Nepal
[2023/11/26 11:50:10] Eric Gao: Really
[2023/11/26 11:50:40] Eric Gao: now back to my second trial testcase
[2023/11/26 11:50:49] Eric Gao: I'm trying 3 more times
[2023/11/26 11:50:49] Sunaya: There actually juices inside like soup
[2023/11/26 11:50:56] Sunaya: Damn m
[2023/11/26 12:03:17] Eric Gao: mashallah finally
[2023/11/26 12:03:42] Sunaya: Oh good
[2023/11/26 12:04:03] Eric Gao: 8 times
[2023/11/26 12:04:33] Sunaya: You wanna bet when I get full?
[2023/11/26 12:04:39] Eric Gao: Ok
[2023/11/26 12:04:40] Eric Gao: Bet
[2023/11/26 12:04:45] Eric Gao: 1 peepee suck
[2023/11/26 12:05:02] Sunaya: When you do you’ll I’ll get full which submission?
[2023/11/26 12:05:12] Sunaya: This is too random tho
[2023/11/26 12:05:16] Sunaya: Ugh
[2023/11/26 12:30:24] Sunaya: eric

[2023/12/7 10:10:57] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/12/7 10:10:59] Sunaya: so you don’t need to pay
[2023/12/7 10:11:06] Eric Gao: I yelled at him yesterday
[2023/12/7 10:11:09] Eric Gao: because he broke my pen
[2023/12/7 10:11:22] Sunaya: Yea he said
[2023/12/7 10:11:30] Eric Gao: good boy
[2023/12/7 10:11:54] Eric Gao: he promised that he will try to reduce nutting over the winter break, so I will let go of this pen
[2023/12/7 10:12:08] Eric Gao: I realized a lot of his problems came from nutting too much
[2023/12/7 10:12:30] Eric Gao: like loss of memory, lack of attention etc.
[2023/12/7 10:12:31] Sunaya: so you want Katsu curry?
[2023/12/7 10:12:35] Eric Gao: sure
[2023/12/7 10:13:02] Sunaya: there’s char su and other roasted chicken and other stuff
[2023/12/7 10:13:08] Sunaya: You sure on katsu curry

[2023/12/7 10:13:24] Eric Gao: make it diverse
[2023/12/7 10:13:33] Sunaya: Okay
[2023/12/7 10:14:45] Eric Gao: how did you do in functional
[2023/12/7 10:15:01] Sunaya: Bad
[2023/12/7 10:15:09] Eric Gao: I feel like I was too not rigorous in the proof
[2023/12/7 10:15:19] Eric Gao: and the work and span I had no idea what I was doing
[2023/12/7 10:15:28] Eric Gao: everything else was fine tho
[2023/12/7 10:15:41] Sunaya: for me it was the last two sections
[2023/12/7 10:15:52] Eric Gao: the stream thing?
[2023/12/7 10:16:01] Sunaya: I didn’t look at mutually exclusive functions at all so k had to make my own stuff
[2023/12/7 10:16:10] Sunaya: I didn’t know how to use and and stuff
[2023/12/7 10:16:14] Eric Gao: it's like
fun something
and something'
[2023/12/7 10:16:35] Eric Gao: it's probably fine
[2023/12/7 10:16:45] Sunaya: Meh I just did something random hopefully I get partial
[2023/12/7 10:16:50] Eric Gao: you should
[2023/12/7 10:17:06] Sunaya: it kinda justified if I get less I was too cocky
[2023/12/7 10:17:12] Eric Gao: I just checked, if assuming I get 90% in my homeworks, I can get 84 in this midterm and still get an A
[2023/12/7 10:17:41] Sunaya: Ooo that’s good
[2023/12/7 10:17:45] Eric Gao: if 95% in hw then 80
[2023/12/7 10:18:15] Eric Gao: adding the second half of the proof and half of the work and span is 14 points
[2023/12/7 10:18:27] Eric Gao: If I messed them up completely I might get a B
[2023/12/7 10:18:44] Sunaya: I see
[2023/12/7 10:18:56] Sunaya: I messed up too
[2023/12/7 10:19:01] Eric Gao: but your need 75?
[2023/12/7 10:19:03] Sunaya: and I think everyone else messed up
[2023/12/7 10:19:17] Eric Gao: the qns were weird man
[2023/12/7 10:19:20] Sunaya: Yea and I don’t know if even that’s possible I blabbered too much
[2023/12/7 10:19:28] Sunaya: I don’t know the right answers
[2023/12/7 10:19:37] Sunaya: So I just assumed a lot of stuff and wrote my stuff
[2023/12/7 10:19:41] Eric Gao: as long as you know how to do stuff it's impossible to get lower than that
[2023/12/7 10:20:13] Eric Gao: I mean you can't really review for this one
[2023/12/7 10:20:28] Eric Gao: it's basically the same thing as the second midterm plus ref
[2023/12/7 10:20:31] Eric Gao: and stream
[2023/12/7 10:20:40] Eric Gao: except the question being much weirder
[2023/12/7 10:21:02] Sunaya: yea
[2023/12/7 10:21:24] Sunaya: you wanna instead go out and eat today?
[2023/12/7 10:21:37] Sunaya: ordering takes too much time I think
[2023/12/7 10:21:39] Eric Gao: I have other plans at 8
[2023/12/7 10:22:01] Eric Gao: ordering is fine

[2023/12/8 02:15:51] Eric Gao: which one did you buy?
[2023/12/8 02:16:05] Sunaya: the lemon on that looks like water
[2023/12/8 02:16:29] Sunaya: Sports drink I think
[2023/12/8 02:16:50] Sunaya: good but it was 7 riyal I think and it’s like drinking water
[2023/12/8 02:17:10] Sunaya: but I like that the flavors are mild
[2023/12/8 02:17:12] Eric Gao: ok
[2023/12/8 02:18:41] Eric Gao: me packing is fast

[2024/1/9 12:04:00] Eric Gao: yea we need to become control freaks man
[2024/1/9 12:04:13] Eric Gao: everything is decided by us
[2024/1/9 12:04:22] Sunaya: i rem someone said no to me hmmmm

[2024/1/9 12:04:37] Eric Gao: yes make them with your iron fist
[2024/1/9 12:27:01] Eric Gao: finally finished reading
[2024/1/9 12:27:05] Eric Gao: I read every single word
[2024/1/9 12:27:13] Eric Gao: but the language is plain enough
[2024/1/9 12:27:29] Sunaya: what was the 636th word
[2024/1/9 12:27:29] Eric Gao: and I think for the quiz we only need to read the summaries and tables
[2024/1/9 12:27:49] Sunaya: this def gonna be on the quiz trust
[2024/1/9 12:27:51] Eric Gao: it's at the 636th place in the book
[2024/1/9 12:28:03] Eric Gao: I can give you an algorithm to look for the answer
[2024/1/9 12:28:10] Eric Gao: but it's class NP
[2024/1/9 12:28:29] Sunaya: ok make it 0(1)
[2024/1/9 12:28:49] Eric Gao: it's "yet"\
[2024/1/9 12:29:01] Eric Gao: now verifying the solution is NP
[2024/1/9 12:29:21] Eric Gao: actually P but not for human brains
[2024/1/9 12:29:40] Sunaya: we have written for CB right
[2024/1/9 12:29:45] Sunaya: when is it gonna be released
[2024/1/9 12:29:58] Eric Gao: yesterday I looked it said in 3 days
[2024/1/9 12:30:06] Eric Gao: prof prob will announce
[2024/1/9 12:30:07] Sunaya: that's the programming one
[2024/1/9 12:31:01] Eric Gao: I looked at the reading it's the exact same thing prof Kemal talked about
[2024/1/9 12:31:09] Sunaya: damn i see lol
[2024/1/9 12:31:31] Sunaya: imagine it's all very similar
[2024/1/9 12:31:49] Eric Gao: we take one class but receive 24 units
[2024/1/9 12:31:51] Sunaya: but we need to switch between python and SML
[2024/1/9 12:32:00] Eric Gao: it's easy la
[2024/1/9 12:32:20] Sunaya: more proactive with imperative and functionla
[2024/1/9 23:43:48] Sunaya: Eric I just realized
[2024/1/9 23:44:14] Sunaya: they you need to send the document of declaration of minor to the advisor and he signs it and then I think you send it to the email
[2024/1/9 23:44:26] Eric Gao: Yea I think that’s the case
‎[2024/1/9 23:44:38] Sunaya:‎<附件：00006181-PHOTO-2024-01-09-23-44-38.jpg>

[2024/1/12 02:49:11] Sunaya: I finally woke up
[2024/1/12 02:49:43] Sunaya: maybe cause you have idea of comp bio already might need a loose upper bound for me

[2024/1/13 06:24:21] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/1/13 06:24:31] Eric Gao: You figured out problem 4 for gti?
[2024/1/13 06:54:01] Sunaya: Nope but I have ideas
[2024/1/13 06:54:19] Sunaya: I went to the arc to get some idea
[2024/1/13 07:01:18] Eric Gao: Ok good good
[2024/1/13 07:02:06] Eric Gao: What are some ideas
[2024/1/13 07:02:23] Eric Gao: I can start thinking now and try to write some stuff before we meet
[2024/1/13 07:11:57] Eric Gao: Hi
[2024/1/13 07:12:48] Sunaya: so you put the domino so that it forms a proper forbidden zone
[2024/1/13 07:13:38] Sunaya: And when you do this it’ll always be the case that black and while are equal however there will be a case that’s the staircase case where black and white is not the same and tiling is not possible
[2024/1/13 07:13:55] Sunaya: what I’m not able to do this show this mathematically
[2024/1/13 07:14:13] Sunaya: like I have the idea but I don’t know how to express it
[2024/1/13 07:14:25] Eric Gao: How do you know this is possible
[2024/1/13 07:14:31] Sunaya: Also we need to write all the proofs with proper structure and rigour
[2024/1/13 07:16:18] Sunaya: cause you create a zone when you place a domino
[2024/1/13 07:18:08] Sunaya: and that zone forms a forbidden zone for when black and white dominos are the same
[2024/1/13 07:28:26] Eric Gao: Didn’t get it
[2024/1/13 10:57:40] Sunaya: You received money?
[2024/1/13 11:02:41] Sunaya: Where the food how long
[2024/1/13 11:07:58] Eric Gao: yes received

[2024/1/13 14:10:18] Sunaya: nah I’m done with it
[2024/1/13 14:16:17] Eric Gao: you'll regret
[2024/1/13 14:16:24] Eric Gao: don't regret
[2024/1/13 14:16:32] Sunaya: Yes that’s why I’m not gonna try
[2024/1/13 14:16:38] Sunaya: I’ll j regret like with Z
[2024/1/13 14:16:41] Eric Gao: stuff like this doesn't happen often
[2024/1/13 14:16:45] Eric Gao: do it while you can
[2024/1/13 14:16:57] Eric Gao: after you leave college you won't have the chance ever again
[2024/1/13 14:17:15] Sunaya: she doesn’t even talk to me anymore
[2024/1/13 14:17:28] Sunaya: unless I make her and be the one to start the interaction
[2024/1/13 14:17:46] Sunaya: so not making the same mistake again
[2024/1/13 14:17:51] Eric Gao: these people are not your friends so you don't have to worry about it
[2024/1/13 14:18:19] Eric Gao: and Z is just Z
[2024/1/13 14:18:37] Eric Gao: under other cultures you can still be besties
[2024/1/13 14:20:05] Sunaya: yea ig but idk what happened she just completely stopped talking like before
[2024/1/13 14:20:23] Eric Gao: last sem you were still talking to each other no?
[2024/1/13 14:20:45] Sunaya: not necessarily she’d talk if I went out of the way to interact with her
[2024/1/13 14:20:52] Sunaya: out of my way
[2024/1/13 14:20:54] Eric Gao: hm
[2024/1/13 14:21:08] Sunaya: but like if I don’t message her she’ll never message me ever
[2024/1/13 14:21:13] Eric Gao: ig if you enjoy talking to her just talk to her, if you don't then you don't have to put so much efforts
[2024/1/13 14:21:26] Sunaya: Or if I don’t go up to her she will never come up to me and talk
[2024/1/13 14:21:38] Eric Gao: I mean she didn't come up to me and talk either
[2024/1/13 14:21:55] Eric Gao: like we chat in school and that's probably it
[2024/1/13 14:22:07] Eric Gao: sometimes she whatsapps me and ask me some questions and we chat for a bit
[2024/1/13 14:22:12] Sunaya: yea but we don’t chat in school too
[2024/1/13 14:22:19] Sunaya: And we have never whatsapped
[2024/1/13 14:22:29] Sunaya: unless I explicitly make her talk
[2024/1/13 14:22:33] Eric Gao: ok you need to chat in school at least because that's the proper way of treating your peers
[2024/1/13 14:22:59] Eric Gao: maybe something like how did you find the social psych reading
[2024/1/13 14:23:06] Sunaya: I try to but like I got tired of always be the first to talk
[2024/1/13 14:23:22] Eric Gao: I understand
[2024/1/13 14:23:59] Eric Gao: just be casual ig, don't feel pressured to talk to her, but also don't feel you can't talk to her
[2024/1/13 14:24:11] Eric Gao: the same way you interact with me is ok
[2024/1/13 14:24:19] Sunaya: That’s the thing of if I don’t pressure it it doesn’t happen
[2024/1/13 14:24:39] Eric Gao: I mean just the usual way you interact with people is fine
[2024/1/13 14:24:51] Eric Gao: like throwing random questions
[2024/1/13 14:24:51] Sunaya: yea ig i do that tho
[2024/1/13 14:27:58] Sunaya: but meh it’s fine I talk to her and if she doesn’t like talking to me ig that’s fine too
[2024/1/13 14:28:22] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/1/13 14:28:38] Eric Gao: This is not worth too much effort tbh
[2024/1/13 14:28:49] Sunaya: true

[2024/1/14 23:50:56] Sunaya: people don’t always like stuff that’s good for them

[2024/2/4 06:09:27] Sunaya: Oh I see
[2024/2/4 06:09:54] Sunaya: They kept track of that and were like oh it seems they split up and are doing different courses
[2024/2/4 06:10:00] Eric Gao: it's just like how you first met Lorenzo and think he's great
[2024/2/4 06:10:06] Sunaya: I didn’t know you applied last sem
[2024/2/4 06:10:11] Sunaya: yea

[2024/2/7 00:03:47] Eric Gao: Goo
[2024/2/7 00:04:48] Sunaya: No fuk
[2024/2/7 00:05:08] Sunaya: alarm didn’t ring
[2024/2/7 00:05:11] Sunaya: I just woke up
[2024/2/7 00:05:13] Eric Gao: Shit
[2024/2/7 00:05:14] Sunaya: shit folk
[2024/2/7 00:05:22] Sunaya: you go I’ll catch up
[2024/2/7 00:05:25] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/2/7 05:19:35] Sunaya: 你好[nǐ hǎo] World!
[2024/2/7 05:45:50] Eric Gao: Yes
[2024/2/7 06:17:11] Sunaya: did you apply
[2024/2/7 06:17:26] Eric Gao: not yet
[2024/2/7 16:15:49] Sunaya: I’ll prolly not attend recitation tomorrow
[2024/2/7 16:16:04] Sunaya: Either sleep more or look up 210
[2024/2/7 23:01:27] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/2/8 10:03:48] Sunaya: You in dorms?
[2024/2/8 10:18:48] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/2/8 11:39:03] Sunaya: For 4 did you do all 16 combinations
[2024/2/8 11:39:25] Sunaya: Make the profile and for each string get the probability of each 4 met
‎[2024/2/8 11:39:36] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00006744-PHOTO-2024-02-08-11-39-36.jpg>
‎[2024/2/8 11:40:06] Sunaya:‎<附件：00006745-PHOTO-2024-02-08-11-40-06.jpg>
[2024/2/8 11:40:14] Sunaya: Yea and then you have to get the motifs
[2024/2/8 11:41:32] Sunaya: but then do you do all combination for each of the 4 strings?
[2024/2/8 11:44:24] Eric Gao: I don't know
[2024/2/8 11:45:00] Sunaya: wait so you just made the matrix?
[2024/2/8 11:45:13] Sunaya: and did you complete 5?
[2024/2/8 11:52:40] Eric Gao: I don't know what 5 is talking about
[2024/2/8 11:52:53] Sunaya: I see I’ll put up a pizzas post
[2024/2/8 11:53:07] Sunaya: cause I have no clue either
[2024/2/8 11:53:31] Sunaya: also where did you say you found the score for the programming randomized motif search
[2024/2/8 11:53:35] Sunaya: on the slides?
[2024/2/8 11:54:01] Eric Gao: I think yea
[2024/2/8 11:54:11] Eric Gao: I don't think expectation maximization is covered
[2024/2/8 11:54:30] Sunaya: right now I am doing column wise consensus
[2024/2/8 11:54:37] Sunaya: Was that your problem
[2024/2/8 11:54:46] Sunaya: I’m so fking tired
[2024/2/8 11:55:24] Sunaya: I think of love tthis course of i wasnt busy and had the time to read properly
[2024/2/8 12:15:24] Eric Gao: no idea
[2024/2/8 12:15:32] Eric Gao: it's just generally confusing
[2024/2/8 12:15:41] Sunaya: alright i put up a piazza post let's see what happens
[2024/2/8 12:37:29] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/8 13:03:58] Eric Gao: shit I've already done q5
[2024/2/8 13:04:03] Sunaya: lol
[2024/2/8 13:04:04] Eric Gao: fuc
[2024/2/8 13:04:18] Sunaya: also
[2024/2/8 13:04:46] Sunaya: I've tried to fix my code it works for inputs1 2 and 3 but gives a different answer for input 4
[2024/2/8 13:05:08] Sunaya: and i'm kinda stuck cause i have no clue where the problem is
[2024/2/8 13:05:14] Sunaya: it's random
[2024/2/8 13:06:05] Eric Gao: sounds bad man
[2024/2/8 15:08:12] Sunaya: finally fixed it
[2024/2/8 15:08:16] Eric Gao: damn
[2024/2/8 15:08:17] Sunaya: yknow what the problem was
[2024/2/8 15:08:20] Eric Gao: what was it
[2024/2/8 15:08:23] Sunaya: it was the fucikng inputs
[2024/2/8 15:08:28] Eric Gao: how
[2024/2/8 15:08:37] Eric Gao: don't you have stripping and stuff?
[2024/2/8 15:08:41] Sunaya: the fucking debug inputs were in a different way
[2024/2/8 15:08:46] Sunaya: compared to the dataset
[2024/2/8 15:08:51] Eric Gao: how did you find out?
[2024/2/8 15:09:13] Sunaya: cause it worked on all the given inputs but didn't work on dataset so i used a debugger to see the variables
[2024/2/8 15:09:14] Eric Gao: ohh right I figured that out too
[2024/2/8 15:09:20] Sunaya: and then saw that
[2024/2/8 15:09:25] Sunaya: fuking god
[2024/2/8 15:09:25] Eric Gao: it's all squeezed in one line
[2024/2/8 15:09:37] Eric Gao: how could you have missed that 😭
[2024/2/8 15:09:52] Eric Gao: always use their input format on the page not debug dataset
[2024/2/8 15:10:08] Sunaya: i was so fixitated on my code being wrong
[2024/2/8 15:10:15] Sunaya: but couldn't find wehre
[2024/2/8 15:10:33] Eric Gao: you would've felt happier if it was actually some problem in your code
[2024/2/8 15:10:42] Eric Gao: but this stupid stuff you must be dying
[2024/2/8 15:10:43] Sunaya: i wasted so much fucking time
[2024/2/8 15:10:49] Sunaya: my head hurts
[2024/2/8 15:11:15] Eric Gao: go sleep man
[2024/2/8 15:11:16] Sunaya: fuck congiterra
[2024/2/8 15:11:59] Sunaya: oh fk i just realized
[2024/2/8 15:12:04] Sunaya: i haven't yet submitted the hw
[2024/2/8 15:12:05] Sunaya: written
[2024/2/8 15:12:08] Sunaya: lmaooo
[2024/2/8 15:12:10] Eric Gao: submit now man
[2024/2/8 15:12:14] Eric Gao: submit and go sleep
[2024/2/11 01:23:29] Sunaya: leave without me
[2024/2/11 01:23:34] Sunaya: I’m going a bit early
[2024/2/11 01:23:50] Eric Gao: I'm on campus
[2024/2/11 01:24:25] Eric Gao: I was supposed to have meeting with hend at 9 but she rescheduled
[2024/2/11 01:25:34] Sunaya: Oh
[2024/2/11 03:59:37] Sunaya: still on cmapus
[2024/2/11 04:08:35] Sunaya: ?
[2024/2/11 04:20:46] Eric Gao: Yes
[2024/2/11 04:39:06] Sunaya: Would you want the exam to be shifted to Wednesday
[2024/2/11 04:39:26] Eric Gao: I'm fine with anything
[2024/2/11 04:39:28] Eric Gao: I already vote
[2024/2/11 04:42:34] Sunaya: me too but now I wish it was tomorrow
[2024/2/11 04:43:00] Eric Gao: why hto
[2024/2/11 04:43:17] Sunaya: I don’t want too much stress for too long
[2024/2/11 04:43:34] Sunaya: And it’s mostly ppl that weren’t even in the hackathon that want it shifted
[2024/2/11 04:43:51] Eric Gao: I mean I want to do randomlab
[2024/2/11 04:43:58] Eric Gao: So yea I don’t know either
[2024/2/11 04:44:20] Sunaya: and we kinda waste two days of gti
[2024/2/11 04:44:38] Sunaya: I feel like it’s already too late for the prof to change it
[2024/2/11 04:49:15] Eric Gao: true
[2024/2/11 04:51:24] Sunaya: ugh now idk what to do
[2024/2/11 04:51:35] Eric Gao: me neither
[2024/2/11 04:51:39] Sunaya: I’ll study like the midterm is tomorrow
[2024/2/11 04:52:08] Sunaya: but I have a lot of other works I need to be doing which I kept off cause of the midterm now this changes everything and just puts more stress
[2024/2/11 04:52:32] Eric Gao: yea kinda true
[2024/2/11 04:52:36] Eric Gao: I have other shit on wednesday
[2024/2/11 04:52:52] Sunaya: yea man
[2024/2/11 04:56:56] Sunaya: did you understand the domino combinotrial proof?
[2024/2/11 04:58:15] Sunaya: also i didn't take part in hackaton cause of the midterm now if the midterm get's shifted i can't go back in time and take part
[2024/2/11 05:02:33] Eric Gao: Didn’t read
[2024/2/11 05:02:42] Eric Gao: Yea I understand
[2024/2/11 05:02:56] Eric Gao: My brain is fucked from the lack of sleep
[2024/2/11 12:26:57] Sunaya: Did you get your score for social psych quiz
[2024/2/11 12:28:18] Sunaya: Idk why I don’t have a score for Jan 24
[2024/2/11 12:28:24] Sunaya: Do you?
[2024/2/11 12:59:17] Eric Gao: I don’t
[2024/2/11 13:02:59] Sunaya: Also idk why I got 4/5 for the prev quiz
[2024/2/11 13:03:06] Sunaya: Even tho I should be getting 5/5
[2024/2/11 13:03:26] Eric Gao: No idea
[2024/2/11 13:03:33] Sunaya: are your scores correct
[2024/2/11 13:03:40] Eric Gao: Oh yea mine as well
[2024/2/11 13:03:51] Sunaya: oh damn
[2024/2/11 13:12:38] Sunaya: are you bak in the dorms?
[2024/2/11 13:20:43] Eric Gao: Now yes
[2024/2/12 11:15:28] Sunaya: did you use buckets for random number generator
[2024/2/12 11:15:57] Sunaya: like if it's divisible by 6 you have 6 buckets, if it's divisible by 3 then 3 buckets
[2024/2/12 11:38:48] Eric Gao: no
[2024/2/12 11:38:55] Eric Gao: I just assumed everything to be real numbers
[2024/2/12 13:07:25] Sunaya: how did you get the upper bound for W | bad of 6.3
[2024/2/12 13:10:39] Eric Gao: same as what prof did in class
[2024/2/12 13:11:05] Eric Gao: E[W(n)|bad] <= E[W(n)] + O(n)
[2024/2/12 13:16:37] Sunaya: hmmmm how is it E[W(n)]?
[2024/2/12 13:17:30] Eric Gao: worst case one side is completely the same
[2024/2/12 13:17:34] Eric Gao: same length
[2024/2/12 13:29:14] Sunaya: let x be number of heads in n coin flips what the probability x is in between n/4 and 3n/4, was this what you ddi to get the probability that it'sgood?
[2024/2/12 13:32:26] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/12 13:32:36] Eric Gao: wait no
[2024/2/12 13:32:41] Sunaya: but then how do you get that probability
[2024/2/12 13:32:42] Eric Gao: wait yes
[2024/2/12 13:32:46] Eric Gao: you have from prev questin
[2024/2/12 13:32:48] Sunaya: like the value for it
[2024/2/12 13:33:20] Sunaya: the Chernoff bound?
[2024/2/12 13:33:41] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/12 13:33:50] Sunaya: 2e^(-n/8) thing
[2024/2/12 13:33:52] Eric Gao: your 6.2 already gave you the probability of good
[2024/2/12 13:33:53] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/12 13:33:56] Eric Gao: j use that
[2024/2/12 13:34:08] Eric Gao: bad
[2024/2/12 13:34:42] Sunaya: so you say prob of good approached 1 as n approaches infinity and kalas?
[2024/2/12 13:35:59] Sunaya: is that it?
[2024/2/12 13:36:24] Sunaya: no way i was using stirling's approximation to try and say that this approaches 1
[2024/2/12 13:54:32] Eric Gao: wtf is that
[2024/2/12 13:54:45] Eric Gao: I didn't say this
[2024/2/12 13:54:56] Eric Gao: just what prof did in class
[2024/2/12 13:55:22] Eric Gao: look at this: https://www.diderot.one/courses/158/books/699/chapter/9917
[2024/2/12 13:57:09] Eric Gao: E[W(n)] = P(bad) * E[W(n)|bad] + P(good) * E[W(n)|good]
[2024/2/12 13:57:29] Eric Gao: you have P(bad) from prev qn
[2024/2/12 13:57:35] Eric Gao: P(good) is just 1-P(bad)
[2024/2/12 13:57:51] Eric Gao: E[W(n)|good] you also know from qn
[2024/2/12 13:58:37] Eric Gao: E[W(n)|bad] is worst case E[W(n)] because it would be calling the same function with a size that didn't change from n
[2024/2/12 13:58:46] Eric Gao: you just put things in a formula and simplify it
[2024/2/12 13:59:13] Sunaya: and it simplifies?
[2024/2/12 13:59:15] Sunaya: damn
[2024/2/12 13:59:23] Eric Gao: yea it does
[2024/2/12 13:59:30] Eric Gao: none of the questions are really hard
[2024/2/12 13:59:41] Eric Gao: at most 15min of thinking you'll know what to do
[2024/2/12 13:59:44] Sunaya: which one did you say was hard
[2024/2/12 13:59:54] Sunaya: 8?
[2024/2/12 14:00:00] Sunaya: was it 7
[2024/2/12 14:00:19] Eric Gao: yea I forgot something from the slides
[2024/2/12 14:00:23] Eric Gao: but it wasn't hard
[2024/2/12 14:00:43] Sunaya: i see was it the select slides?
[2024/2/12 14:00:52] Eric Gao: 9.1 and 9.2 was not that easy
[2024/2/12 14:01:03] Eric Gao: the one with analyzing randomized algos
[2024/2/12 14:01:18] Eric Gao: just needs some thinking but not hard also
[2024/2/12 14:01:23] Sunaya: i see okay thanks
[2024/2/12 14:01:30] Eric Gao: np
[2024/2/12 14:01:32] Sunaya: i feel like i'm overcomplicating everyhting
[2024/2/12 14:04:28] Eric Gao: yea you are
[2024/2/12 14:04:31] Eric Gao: it's not that hard
[2024/2/12 14:04:38] Eric Gao: nothing new from what prof did in class
‎[2024/2/12 15:31:55] Sunaya:‎<附件：00006906-PHOTO-2024-02-12-15-31-55.jpg>
[2024/2/12 15:33:48] Sunaya: The Xi and Yi should should be expectation
[2024/2/12 15:34:25] Sunaya: was this your answer for 8
Thus, the probability of selecting T[n/2] before any other element from this range is 1/(n/2 + 1).
[2024/2/12 23:23:59] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/12 23:24:19] Eric Gao: no but I'm not sure about 8
[2024/2/12 23:25:46] Eric Gao: I had 2 case: T[n/2] was a pivot (in this case the other two are definitely compared, this has probability 1/n); T[n/2] was never a pivot ((n-1)/n prob), in which case both the other two have to be pivots (each with prob 1/(n-1)). I just did some condional prob stuff and added them
[2024/2/13 23:46:12] Sunaya: What time are you leaving
[2024/2/13 23:46:41] Sunaya: I just woke up so might be a bit late
[2024/2/13 23:46:48] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/2/13 23:47:06] Eric Gao: You can leave at 8?
[2024/2/13 23:47:25] Sunaya: I’ll see
[2024/2/13 23:47:27] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/2/13 23:47:36] Sunaya: Did you make cheat sheet
[2024/2/13 23:47:39] Eric Gao: Nope
[2024/2/13 23:47:44] Sunaya: me neither
[2024/2/13 23:47:48] Eric Gao: I don’t know what to put there
[2024/2/13 23:47:59] Sunaya: Do you know about the pancake network?
[2024/2/13 23:48:11] Eric Gao: Kinda
[2024/2/13 23:48:23] Sunaya: I forgot to look at that
[2024/2/13 23:48:37] Eric Gao: I remember two nodes are connected iff their pancake stack differ by 1 flip
[2024/2/13 23:48:42] Sunaya: Yea
[2024/2/13 23:49:01] Sunaya: I kinda don’t wanna attend comp bio today
[2024/2/13 23:49:05] Sunaya: Are you attending?
[2024/2/13 23:49:16] Eric Gao: I’m going ig
[2024/2/13 23:49:22] Eric Gao: I don’t know man
[2024/2/13 23:50:14] Sunaya: so you’re attending?

[2024/2/13 23:51:30] Sunaya: cause gti legit messed up my whole schedule
[2024/2/13 23:51:40] Eric Gao: Yea I see
[2024/2/13 23:51:40] Sunaya: I have too much work cause I spent too much time on gti
[2024/2/13 23:51:56] Sunaya: Did you do comp bio written
[2024/2/13 23:51:59] Sunaya: it’s due tomorrow
[2024/2/13 23:52:04] Eric Gao: Fuck. O
[2024/2/13 23:52:06] Eric Gao: *no

[2024/2/13 23:53:17] Sunaya: all cause of gti messed everything up
[2024/2/13 23:54:36] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/2/13 23:54:51] Sunaya: Also we have quiz for gti
[2024/2/13 23:54:55] Sunaya: tomorrow!
[2024/2/13 23:55:04] Eric Gao: fucj
[2024/2/13 23:55:45] Sunaya: yea I kinda don’t wanna attend comp bio today
[2024/2/13 23:55:59] Sunaya: I’ll see if I get ready quick I’ll come
[2024/2/13 23:56:42] Sunaya: If she ask tell her extremely busy over slept  he said he’ll come might be a bit late
[2024/2/13 23:56:55] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/14 00:01:10] Eric Gao: I’m leaving now
[2024/2/14 09:52:40] Sunaya: you're still on campus?
[2024/2/14 09:56:59] Eric Gao: Ye
[2024/2/14 09:57:07] Eric Gao: Wya
[2024/2/14 09:57:22] Sunaya: 1199
[2024/2/14 09:57:30] Eric Gao: K
[2024/2/14 10:45:18] Eric Gao: 1000 genomes: what variants are there for each individual (2504 people, each has 2 chromosomes, so 5008 total chromosomes) - vcf file

vcf file: for every variant, what is the variation, and who has it

For every variant in the vcf, inserted that variant into the genome

Then find palindrome for each sequence, referring to each palindrome by its center position (pick the smaller index)

Check the positions for pathogetic snps

Look for the transcription factor binding locations

Interesting palindromes with disease-causing SNPs that are not yet identified as TF sites
[2024/2/14 23:47:18] Sunaya: What time are you planning to go
[2024/2/14 23:47:47] Eric Gao: 8
[2024/2/14 23:51:35] Sunaya: isn’t today recitation
[2024/2/14 23:51:40] Sunaya: Starts at 8:45
[2024/2/14 23:51:41] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/2/14 23:51:47] Eric Gao: Ok leave 8:15 then
[2024/2/15 00:15:51] Sunaya: out
[2024/2/15 00:16:25] Eric Gao: Out
[2024/2/16 11:31:57] Sunaya: did you start 210? what representation are you using?
[2024/2/16 11:32:05] Eric Gao: started
[2024/2/16 11:32:25] Eric Gao: tree view, (k1, k2), and a sequence of ancestors
‎[2024/2/16 11:33:06] Sunaya:‎<附件：00006975-PHOTO-2024-02-16-11-33-06.jpg>

[2024/2/16 11:33:42] Eric Gao: same
[2024/2/16 11:35:35] Sunaya: your brightness seems to a bit too high
[2024/2/16 11:36:00] Eric Gao: I can see so good enough
‎[2024/2/16 11:36:12] Sunaya:‎<附件：00006980-PHOTO-2024-02-16-11-36-12.jpg>
[2024/2/16 11:36:19] Eric Gao: wut
[2024/2/16 11:36:21] Sunaya: lol
[2024/2/16 11:36:24] Sunaya: it shows on my phone tho
[2024/2/16 11:36:26] Sunaya: j checked
[2024/2/16 11:36:34] Sunaya: how far are you into 210?
[2024/2/16 11:37:04] Sunaya: i'm so sleepy already i tried to watch the video in trees the pitsburg one if it'd help but j waste of time
[2024/2/16 11:37:15] Eric Gao: not too far
[2024/2/16 11:37:19] Sunaya: at least i finished comp bio programming and written
[2024/2/16 11:37:26] Eric Gao: I just finished lift root and first
[2024/2/16 11:37:35] Sunaya: and look at gti a bit 1, 2, 3, is easy 4, 5 are the hard ones
[2024/2/16 11:37:39] Sunaya: looked
[2024/2/16 11:38:00] Sunaya: i see i see
[2024/2/16 11:39:28] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/2/16 12:14:38] Sunaya: isnt' a treeview basically a seq but in tree form like it's <1, 2, 3, 4, ... n> a seq but represented as a tree right
[2024/2/16 12:18:30] Sunaya: nvm
[2024/2/16 12:18:41] Sunaya: i confused treeview with Tree.view
[2024/2/16 12:26:42] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/17 00:03:51] Eric Gao: do compbio deliverable today
[2024/2/17 00:03:55] Eric Gao: I sent you an invite
[2024/2/17 00:03:58] Eric Gao: on google docs
[2024/2/17 00:04:32] Eric Gao: we mainly need 2 parts: background literature (similar to the introduction part of a paper) and analysis code/data setup
[2024/2/17 00:04:35] Eric Gao: which part do you want to do
[2024/2/17 00:20:33] Sunaya: I can do the background literature
[2024/2/17 00:21:20] Sunaya: What would we need to do for analysis code/ data setup?
[2024/2/17 00:21:40] Sunaya: Which one do you think would be more appropriate for me since I have lesser bio knowledge
[2024/2/17 00:22:15] Eric Gao: I think the code part for you then, background might need some bio stuff
[2024/2/17 00:22:26] Eric Gao: I wrote in the docs what we need to do for the coding part
[2024/2/17 00:23:17] Eric Gao: mainly just write a python script that takes each row of one database  (prof Madhavi's database) and use an API to extract similar information from the other (dbSNP)
[2024/2/17 00:49:16] Sunaya: okay
[2024/2/17 00:49:40] Sunaya: also how do i get open the Sirius server?
[2024/2/17 00:49:56] Eric Gao: ssh to sirius.qatar.cmu.edu
[2024/2/17 00:50:08] Eric Gao: with Qatar campus vpn connected
‎[2024/2/17 00:51:32] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007013-PHOTO-2024-02-17-00-51-32.jpg>
[2024/2/17 00:52:31] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/17 00:55:14] Eric Gao: also you don't even need to run with the actual data
[2024/2/17 00:55:34] Eric Gao: just read the format of the databases, write a simple script, and test it if you want
[2024/2/17 00:56:29] Sunaya: ok
‎[2024/2/17 01:18:10] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007018-PHOTO-2024-02-17-01-18-10.jpg>
[2024/2/17 01:18:22] Eric Gao: under /data I think
‎[2024/2/17 01:19:26] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007020-PHOTO-2024-02-17-01-19-26.jpg>
[2024/2/17 01:20:14] Eric Gao: we should email madhavi then, but for now you can use whatever's on Madhavi's website
[2024/2/17 01:20:22] Eric Gao: http://severus.dbmi.pitt.edu/palins.html
[2024/2/17 01:20:28] Eric Gao: under full catalogue
[2024/2/17 01:22:45] Sunaya: i downloaded that what do you use to open that cause if i use notepad or anything liek that it say's it's too big for it to open
‎[2024/2/17 01:22:58] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007025-PHOTO-2024-02-17-01-22-58.jpg>
[2024/2/17 01:23:48] Eric Gao: what's this file?
[2024/2/17 01:23:53] Sunaya: tsv
[2024/2/17 01:24:08] Eric Gao: yea but was this prof Madhavi's file?
[2024/2/17 01:24:13] Sunaya: yes
‎[2024/2/17 01:24:28] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007030-PHOTO-2024-02-17-01-24-28.jpg>
[2024/2/17 01:24:45] Eric Gao: go to command line and do head
[2024/2/17 01:24:45] Sunaya: i'll email her about the server too see what she says
[2024/2/17 01:25:17] Sunaya: okay nice
‎[2024/2/17 01:34:33] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007034-PHOTO-2024-02-17-01-34-33.jpg>
[2024/2/17 01:35:16] Sunaya: wait there should be a readme
[2024/2/17 01:36:24] Eric Gao: is there a header in this file?
[2024/2/17 01:36:26] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/17 01:36:35] Sunaya: the header is useless
[2024/2/17 01:36:47] Eric Gao: it looks like vcf file
[2024/2/17 01:37:04] Eric Gao: I don't know what it is
[2024/2/17 01:37:30] Sunaya: i'll fiddle with it more and look at the readme
[2024/2/17 01:37:32] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/17 02:51:12] Eric Gao: I'm done with background literature review, take a read and lmk if you have any suggsetions
[2024/2/17 02:51:34] Eric Gao: also let me know if there's anything I can do with the analysis part
[2024/2/17 03:03:30] Sunaya: ok
[2024/2/17 03:12:10] Sunaya: I looked at it looks good
[2024/2/17 03:12:23] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/17 03:12:49] Sunaya: Did you submit Spain essay?
[2024/2/17 03:12:59] Eric Gao: for scholarship no
[2024/2/17 03:13:09] Sunaya: oh damn
[2024/2/17 03:13:12] Eric Gao: I'll finish 210 and do that
[2024/2/17 03:13:27] Sunaya: I did it yesterday
[2024/2/17 03:14:22] Eric Gao: yea I'll try to write it more properly
[2024/2/17 03:14:39] Eric Gao: I just threw whatever I had in the essay to chatgpt
[2024/2/17 06:20:17] Sunaya: did you finish 210?
[2024/2/17 06:20:38] Sunaya: I did the search for but my next and others don’t work I think
[2024/2/17 06:26:41] Eric Gao: my next also didn't work
[2024/2/17 06:33:38] Sunaya: Do you know if your first is working?
[2024/2/17 06:33:48] Sunaya: I don’t know if it’s first or next
[2024/2/17 06:33:53] Sunaya: That’s not working
[2024/2/17 06:34:11] Sunaya: I have a feeling it’s first but I’ve spend too much time on this
[2024/2/17 06:36:04] Sunaya: Are you using first in next?
[2024/2/17 06:39:36] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/17 06:39:40] Eric Gao: I don't know which one is working
[2024/2/17 09:24:47] Sunaya: I might need a bit of help with the data analysis I’ll come to your room at night
[2024/2/17 09:24:49] Sunaya: When is a good time to come
[2024/2/17 09:25:03] Eric Gao: anytime should be ok
[2024/2/17 12:11:42] Eric Gao: come before 10pm because I feel like I might accidentally fall asleep today
[2024/2/18 00:00:47] Sunaya: Ok
[2024/2/18 00:02:03] Sunaya: I will come today
[2024/2/18 00:04:39] Eric Gao: hows gti
[2024/2/18 00:06:44] Sunaya: It’s alright
[2024/2/18 00:06:53] Sunaya: I’m more scared about 210
[2024/2/18 00:06:58] Eric Gao: what's your answer for 4b in gti
[2024/2/18 00:07:26] Sunaya: we assume there is atleast 1 out of the 63 people is not invited meaning expected number of people not invited is atleast 1
[2024/2/18 00:07:48] Sunaya: Using contradiction
[2024/2/18 00:09:17] Eric Gao: what
[2024/2/18 00:09:33] Sunaya: 4b right
[2024/2/18 00:09:38] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/18 00:09:43] Eric Gao: I didn't get your explanation
[2024/2/18 00:10:10] Eric Gao: how does at least 1 out of 63 people not being invited mean the expectation is at least 1
[2024/2/18 00:10:45] Eric Gao: say there are 1000 trials, in one trial 1 gets invited, the rest 999 cases no one was left over, so the expectation still is less than 1
[2024/2/18 00:14:00] Sunaya: hmmm this is what I said, we take the opposite of the statement so assume the expected is at least one person is not invited but there’s contradiction cause we showed otherwise
[2024/2/18 00:15:01] Sunaya: The 63 made the prev confusing
[2024/2/18 00:17:05] Eric Gao: that's still the expectation tho, reversing the statement means "the expected number of friends who was not invited is >= 1", and how do you use contradiction to link this to "there must be a choice of friends such that everyone is invited"?
[2024/2/18 00:17:33] Eric Gao: or did you reverse "there is not a choice of friends that everyone is invited"
[2024/2/18 00:18:28] Sunaya: wait lemme look at the Qn again
[2024/2/18 00:18:38] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/18 00:22:01] Sunaya: hmmm I get what you mean, this is what I reversed, so there doesn’t exist a choice of 63 friends where everyone will be invited
[2024/2/18 00:22:16] Sunaya: I kinda see my thing is not formal enough or robots
[2024/2/18 00:22:25] Eric Gao: exactly
[2024/2/18 00:24:04] Sunaya: I was like from 1b when we randomly choose 63 friends the expected who will not receive is less than one so there must be but this doesn’t really prove anything
[2024/2/18 00:24:25] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/2/18 00:24:33] Eric Gao: expectation is the average of events
[2024/2/18 00:25:50] Sunaya: Hmmmm
[2024/2/18 00:25:57] Sunaya: Shit
[2024/2/18 00:37:33] Sunaya: Average can't be <1 if nothing is <1
[2024/2/18 00:39:18] Sunaya: so there has to be one case that makes it 0?
[2024/2/18 00:42:52] Sunaya: okay I think I can properly explain now
[2024/2/18 00:43:15] Sunaya: I’ll explain while we walk towards campus
[2024/2/18 00:49:01] Sunaya: Fk I got the timing wrong I thought we were gonna move out at 9
[2024/2/18 00:49:10] Sunaya: I was rushing for no reason
[2024/2/18 00:59:14] Eric Gao: I'm already on campus
[2024/2/18 00:59:20] Sunaya: oh
[2024/2/18 00:59:23] Eric Gao: I have an independent study meeting
[2024/2/18 00:59:35] Eric Gao: not necessarily 0
[2024/2/18 00:59:41] Eric Gao: but something smaller than 1 yes
[2024/2/18 01:01:31] Sunaya: wound that prove it?
[2024/2/18 01:01:40] Eric Gao: I don't think so
[2024/2/18 01:01:44] Sunaya: cause you can’t have a being less than 1
[2024/2/18 01:01:54] Eric Gao: ok explain the whole thing again
[2024/2/18 01:04:36] Sunaya: so let’s take the opposite, for all choice of friend at least one is not invited.  When this happens the expectation is greater or equal to 1 cause in all cases we have that one person is not invited but we just showed that for any choice of 63 it’s not the case thus a contradiction. This the negation of it must be true I.e what we want to show
[2024/2/18 01:07:40] Sunaya: makes sense?
[2024/2/18 01:08:49] Eric Gao: "When this happens the expectation is greater or equal to 1 cause in all cases we have that one person is not invited" why
[2024/2/18 01:08:55] Eric Gao: why all cases
[2024/2/18 01:09:22] Sunaya: isn’t the negation for there exist, for all?
[2024/2/18 01:10:33] Eric Gao: oh right ok
[2024/2/18 01:10:36] Eric Gao: lemme read again after meeting
[2024/2/18 01:11:02] Sunaya: I’m k
[2024/2/18 01:11:03] Sunaya: ok
[2024/2/18 01:46:24] Eric Gao: Ok yes you’re right
[2024/2/18 06:00:03] Sunaya: Are you back in dorms
[2024/2/18 06:01:45] Eric Gao: on campus
[2024/2/18 06:06:39] Sunaya: oh why?
[2024/2/18 06:13:23] Eric Gao: Podcast meeting at 4
[2024/2/18 06:41:34] Sunaya: Oh

[2024/2/18 16:27:00] Sunaya: at least i think that the problem for me
‎[2024/2/18 16:27:58] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007146-PHOTO-2024-02-18-16-27-58.jpg>
[2024/2/18 17:21:02] Sunaya: ok fk idk what's the problem
[2024/2/18 22:24:35] Eric Gao: I’m pretty sure I have the same issue
[2024/2/18 22:24:43] Eric Gao: You managed to solve it?
[2024/2/18 22:41:35] Eric Gao: I thought about it, when using first in next, replace the last thing in the sequence it returns with the right range
[2024/2/18 22:41:49] Eric Gao: I don’t know what the range should be tho
[2024/2/18 23:31:40] Sunaya: No I haven’t fixed it
[2024/2/18 23:36:36] Sunaya: Not only did I not get sleep I wasn’t able to fix it too
[2024/2/18 23:36:57] Eric Gao: 😢
[2024/2/18 23:57:31] Sunaya: let go
[2024/2/18 23:57:54] Eric Gao: K
[2024/2/19 00:02:02] Sunaya: Where is you
[2024/2/19 02:02:12] Sunaya: I’m getting range out of bound error
[2024/2/19 02:05:36] Sunaya: ‎未接语音通话
[2024/2/19 02:36:49] Sunaya: and i can't seem to fix it
[2024/2/19 02:49:11] Sunaya: I’m gonna go sleep in the mindfulness
[2024/2/19 04:56:14] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/19 11:08:39] Sunaya: Sadly my code still doesn’t pass all the test cases on Gradescope
[2024/2/19 11:08:47] Sunaya: Passes the local one
[2024/2/19 11:09:09] Sunaya: I’m about to eat and sleep I’m too tired
[2024/2/19 11:27:17] Eric Gao: Damn
[2024/2/19 11:27:41] Eric Gao: I’ll try to fix it for an hour then I’ll do something else
[2024/2/19 14:36:14] Sunaya: were you able to fix it
‎[2024/2/19 16:43:01] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007169-PHOTO-2024-02-19-16-43-01.jpg>

[2024/2/19 22:38:31] Eric Gao: I didn’t fix it
[2024/2/20 01:12:34] Sunaya: Are you already on cmapus?
[2024/2/20 01:47:30] Eric Gao: Yes
[2024/2/20 03:12:26] Sunaya: val l1 = N(L, 6, L);

[2024/2/20 05:28:39] Sunaya: Your food with Haolin
[2024/2/20 05:31:06] Eric Gao: Where is haolin
[2024/2/20 05:31:22] Eric Gao: You know he doesn’t reply to messages right
[2024/2/20 05:33:03] Sunaya: He teplies to calls
[2024/2/20 05:33:10] Eric Gao: Ok

[2024/2/20 13:17:13] Eric Gao: I can finally sleep on time today
[2024/2/20 13:18:15] Eric Gao: huda helped me a lot
[2024/2/20 13:18:30] Eric Gao: I was sitting in the lab room and she sat right behind
[2024/2/20 13:18:43] Eric Gao: otherwise I wouldn't be able to sleep by 11 tonight
[2024/2/20 13:19:57] Sunaya: I see
[2024/2/20 13:20:41] Eric Gao: you finished written?
[2024/2/20 13:20:46] Sunaya: sorta
[2024/2/20 13:20:53] Sunaya: Idk if it’s correct
[2024/2/20 13:21:10] Eric Gao: first three are either all correct or all wrong
[2024/2/20 13:21:34] Eric Gao: the O(log(j-i+1)) one should be easy
[2024/2/20 13:21:36] Eric Gao: last one I'm not sure
[2024/2/20 13:22:47] Sunaya: I have OB midterm tomorrow and I haven’t yet started to study for it
[2024/2/20 13:22:54] Sunaya: and I haven’t looked at anything
[2024/2/20 13:23:04] Eric Gao: damn

[2024/2/21 12:46:19] Eric Gao: I just began reviewing for 210 40min ago
[2024/2/21 12:46:31] Sunaya: i see i'm looking at the textbook
[2024/2/21 12:46:34] Sunaya: it's actually good
[2024/2/21 12:46:54] Eric Gao: wow ok
[2024/2/21 12:47:00] Eric Gao: which one

‎[2024/2/21 12:48:05] Sunaya: textbook.pdf • ‎455页‎<附件：00007222-textbook.pdf>
[2024/2/21 12:48:27] Sunaya: I can only see upload for pdf
[2024/2/21 12:48:34] Sunaya: so ig don't need to upload code
‎[2024/2/21 12:48:37] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007225-PHOTO-2024-02-21-12-48-37.jpg>
[2024/2/21 12:48:51] Eric Gao: put a screenshot of the code there
[2024/2/21 12:48:59] Sunaya: added you as a group i think you'll be able to see
[2024/2/21 12:49:00] Sunaya: okay
[2024/2/21 12:50:39] Sunaya: also
[2024/2/21 12:50:44] Sunaya: who won the trivia?
[2024/2/21 12:50:49] Eric Gao: some freshies
[2024/2/21 12:50:54] Eric Gao: CS people
[2024/2/21 12:50:57] Sunaya: damn
[2024/2/21 12:51:11] Eric Gao: they got way too competitive
[2024/2/21 12:51:20] Sunaya: what were the prizes
[2024/2/21 12:51:25] Sunaya: like what type of tablet
[2024/2/21 12:51:26] Sunaya: and watch
[2024/2/21 12:51:53] Eric Gao: mi smart band
[2024/2/21 12:51:59] Eric Gao: mi tablet
[2024/2/21 12:52:03] Sunaya: i see
[2024/2/21 12:52:09] Sunaya: how does your club have so much momney
[2024/2/21 12:52:12] Eric Gao: also a camera similar to polarid
[2024/2/21 12:52:17] Sunaya: damn
[2024/2/21 12:52:30] Sunaya: oh yea i fked up OB
[2024/2/21 12:52:33] Sunaya: it's fking hard man
[2024/2/21 12:52:38] Sunaya: i found it harder than 210 quiz
[2024/2/21 12:52:41] Eric Gao: Lujain paid for some of them, and they were not too pricy overall
[2024/2/21 12:52:49] Eric Gao: damn what happened in ob
[2024/2/21 12:52:56] Eric Gao: everyone fucked up?
[2024/2/21 12:52:58] Sunaya: hard as fk qns
[2024/2/21 12:53:02] Sunaya: i think it was only me
[2024/2/21 12:53:07] Sunaya: idk i hate humanities courses
[2024/2/21 12:53:07] Eric Gao: why tho
[2024/2/21 12:53:12] Eric Gao: you had that cheat sheet
[2024/2/21 12:53:14] Sunaya: never did well on them
[2024/2/21 12:53:19] Sunaya: yea he made the most confusing qns
[2024/2/21 12:53:31] Sunaya: didn't have enough time to properly complete too
[2024/2/21 12:54:16] Eric Gao: damn
[2024/2/21 12:54:52] Sunaya: also i'm skipping CB tomorrow
[2024/2/21 12:55:05] Sunaya: recitation and according to syllabus it shouldn't count for attendance
[2024/2/21 12:55:06] Eric Gao: yea makes sense
[2024/2/21 12:55:22] Sunaya: you going?
[2024/2/21 12:55:27] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/2/21 15:02:43] Eric Gao: are we allowed cheatsheet for 210?
[2024/2/21 15:02:50] Sunaya: yeaa
[2024/2/21 15:02:54] Eric Gao: oh ok
[2024/2/21 15:02:59] Eric Gao: should I...
[2024/2/21 15:03:13] Sunaya: no idea idk how useful it gonna be
[2024/2/21 15:03:17] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/2/21 15:03:34] Eric Gao: I never used my cheatsheet
‎[2024/2/21 15:05:25] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00007271-PHOTO-2024-02-21-15-05-25.jpg>

[2024/2/21 15:05:42] Eric Gao: ok ty
[2024/2/21 15:05:45] Sunaya: oh wisy
[2024/2/21 15:05:50] Sunaya: i think ordered sets too
[2024/2/21 15:05:51] Sunaya: yea
[2024/2/21 15:05:57] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/21 15:05:59] Sunaya: everything until last last class
[2024/2/21 15:07:59] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/2/23 06:27:57] Sunaya: so you’re not coming right?
[2024/2/23 09:12:04] Sunaya: ??
[2024/2/23 09:53:53] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/2 01:40:00] Eric Gao: did GTI?
[2024/3/2 01:41:03] Eric Gao: I'm left with 1e, 4, and 5
[2024/3/2 01:41:25] Sunaya: Oh damn
[2024/3/2 01:41:32] Sunaya: Gonna do it now
[2024/3/2 01:41:41] Eric Gao: ok lemme know how it goes
[2024/3/2 01:41:45] Sunaya: Ok
[2024/3/2 06:33:32] Eric Gao: you managed to p4?
[2024/3/2 06:33:44] Eric Gao: this feels like a matching problem
[2024/3/2 07:04:43] Sunaya: yea I think it is a matching one too
[2024/3/2 07:06:12] Eric Gao: Hows p5
[2024/3/2 07:06:30] Sunaya: no good
[2024/3/2 07:06:42] Eric Gao: yea me too
[2024/3/2 07:14:11] Sunaya: i'm so sleepy and hungry
[2024/3/2 07:14:30] Eric Gao: What dinner you want
[2024/3/2 07:14:39] Sunaya: no idea
[2024/3/2 07:14:52] Eric Gao: You at dorm?
[2024/3/2 07:14:59] Sunaya: yea
[2024/3/2 07:15:05] Eric Gao: Ok I’ll come to you
[2024/3/2 07:15:11] Eric Gao: Let’s finish gti and eat
[2024/3/2 07:15:22] Sunaya: i ordered lunch alsreadt tho
[2024/3/2 07:15:33] Eric Gao: Dinner
[2024/3/2 07:15:43] Sunaya: alright
[2024/3/2 07:15:49] Sunaya: i kinda wanna eat at three peppers
[2024/3/2 07:15:56] Sunaya: the noodles so good there
[2024/3/2 07:16:06] Sunaya: we can decide once we finish gti
[2024/3/2 07:16:33] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/2 12:40:09] Eric Gao: any luck with the qns?
[2024/3/2 12:43:46] Sunaya: sorta
[2024/3/2 12:43:58] Eric Gao: wjat
[2024/3/2 12:44:04] Eric Gao: 2a done?
[2024/3/2 12:44:08] Eric Gao: 5 has an idea?
[2024/3/2 12:44:11] Sunaya: nope i'm thiknig about 5
[2024/3/2 12:44:35] Sunaya: can we connect the forest so that it a connected tree right
[2024/3/2 12:45:04] Sunaya: now we have a connected whole tree right? with some 2k odd vertices right ‎<这条消息已经过编辑>
[2024/3/2 12:45:58] Sunaya: if we make all those odd vertices even we have a eulerian circuit
[2024/3/2 12:46:38] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/3/2 12:47:33] Sunaya: if we start removing those edges and vertices we added to make it an eulerain circuit the first one we remove we create one eulerian line right cause we'll create 2 odd vertices, if we remove the second we will create another path and if we keep doing that we will have k paths each that will cover everything
[2024/3/2 12:47:50] Sunaya: also
[2024/3/2 12:47:54] Sunaya: 2a i think i have an idea
[2024/3/2 12:48:31] Eric Gao: interesting. but this is only true when the forest is just one tree?
[2024/3/2 12:48:35] Sunaya: yes
[2024/3/2 12:48:49] Eric Gao: how about when it's not connected
[2024/3/2 12:49:29] Sunaya: i'm thinking we'll have two cases i.e either single eulerian cycle or two disjoint graphs each with eulerian cycle
[2024/3/2 12:50:20] Sunaya: like when connecting the odd vertices right it can be the case that it's within only that element of the set, or two elements of the set being merged when connecting the odd vertices
[2024/3/2 12:50:43] Eric Gao: also, how do you connect the subparts so that eularian circuits occur
[2024/3/2 12:52:11] Eric Gao: say there are 3 connected components in the forest, you can either connect them onto 1 line (which creates no circuits) or connect them into something like a triangle
[2024/3/2 12:52:16] Sunaya: say there's 2k odd vertices right we add additional k vertices and each one of the two of the 2k connects with one of the additional k vertices
[2024/3/2 12:53:12] Eric Gao: you're just writing English
[2024/3/2 12:53:45] Sunaya: wait my delivery arrived I’ll go pick it up
[2024/3/2 12:53:56] Eric Gao: you still hungry?
[2024/3/2 12:54:06] Sunaya: The underwear
[2024/3/2 12:54:10] Eric Gao: ohh
[2024/3/2 12:54:54] Sunaya: what do you mean by 3 connected components cna you draw and show
[2024/3/2 12:55:35] Eric Gao: imagine 3 vertex, each one is abstractly a tree
[2024/3/2 12:56:03] Eric Gao: to make these connected, you either add 2 or 3 edges
[2024/3/2 12:56:37] Eric Gao: if you added 2 edges then this will not create any eularian circuit
‎[2024/3/2 13:11:10] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007340-PHOTO-2024-03-02-13-11-10.jpg>
[2024/3/2 13:11:22] Sunaya: The first one is a forest we have 3 different trees
[2024/3/2 13:11:31] Sunaya: Connected them with purple edge
[2024/3/2 13:11:50] Sunaya: And then red indicate newly added edges and node to make it eulerian
[2024/3/2 13:15:48] Sunaya: wait i was drawing trees and is this one of the property of tree
[2024/3/2 13:15:58] Sunaya: it always has an even number of odd vertices
[2024/3/2 13:17:02] Eric Gao: ohh ok
[2024/3/2 13:17:21] Eric Gao: hmm ok
[2024/3/2 13:17:23] Sunaya: if it always has an even number of odd vertices we can look at each tree separately and make each tree in the forest an eulerian cycle
[2024/3/2 13:21:36] Eric Gao: hmm
[2024/3/2 13:22:28] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/3/3 04:39:19] Eric Gao: What did you get for podcast

[2024/3/6 13:21:39] Eric Gao: Yes
[2024/3/6 13:21:45] Sunaya: why tho?
[2024/3/6 13:22:01] Sunaya: Did you see the piazza post?
[2024/3/6 13:22:29] Eric Gao: Short answer is that I promised myself way back that if I would have the chance to study computer science as my major then I will not skip any of my classes
[2024/3/6 13:22:53] Sunaya: what if you happen to fall asleep
[2024/3/6 13:22:55] Eric Gao: I know whom to count on to attend
[2024/3/6 13:23:01] Eric Gao: This is obviously me
[2024/3/6 13:23:16] Sunaya: yea I’ll see what to do
[2024/3/6 13:23:20] Sunaya: Might attend
[2024/3/6 13:23:27] Eric Gao: I won’t
[2024/3/6 13:24:00] Sunaya: I really don’t wanna attend but since I’ve attended all classes ig I’ll attend this one too
[2024/3/6 13:24:38] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/7 00:09:19] Eric Gao: You coming?

[2024/3/7 07:00:47] Eric Gao: you not going to international night?
[2024/3/7 08:11:54] Sunaya: No
[2024/3/7 08:15:08] Eric Gao: Ok I’ll come back to dorm
[2024/3/7 08:46:12] Sunaya: Brazil arginntina Uruguay Venezuela Columbia
[2024/3/7 08:55:45] Sunaya: Senegal gunie Ivory Coast Ghana Nigeria
[2024/3/7 09:16:53] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/8 03:22:56] Sunaya: It seems that I am sick
[2024/3/8 03:55:58] Eric Gao: what
[2024/3/8 03:56:00] Eric Gao: fever?
[2024/3/8 03:56:02] Eric Gao: sore throat?
[2024/3/9 00:32:07] Sunaya: yes and no
[2024/3/9 00:34:22] Eric Gao: you took medicine?
[2024/3/9 00:46:50] Sunaya: not really
[2024/3/9 00:47:28] Eric Gao: take medicine bro
[2024/3/9 00:47:34] Eric Gao: I have Panadol you want?
[2024/3/9 00:49:16] Sunaya: no it’s fine
[2024/3/9 00:49:27] Sunaya: I’ll take medicine if it gets worse
[2024/3/9 00:50:33] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/3/9 09:50:24] Sunaya: how did you do 2 again
[2024/3/9 09:50:29] Sunaya: cause it doesn't work
[2024/3/9 09:50:57] Sunaya: i tried it with smaller graphs and none of the formula works comp bio
[2024/3/9 09:51:05] Eric Gao: wdym
[2024/3/9 09:51:33] Sunaya: i used m*n or 2m*n or m^2n + n^2m nothing works
[2024/3/9 09:51:39] Eric Gao: I didn't have those
[2024/3/9 09:51:52] Eric Gao: I said O(n^2m+m^2n)
‎[2024/3/9 09:52:28] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007479-PHOTO-2024-03-09-09-52-28.jpg>
[2024/3/9 09:52:28] Eric Gao: the formula is
#indel edges before + #indel edges added
[2024/3/9 09:52:35] Eric Gao: no
[2024/3/9 09:52:56] Sunaya: is this indel edges before?
[2024/3/9 09:53:12] Eric Gao: indel edges are only the vertical and horizontal edges
[2024/3/9 09:53:18] Eric Gao: diagnol ones are substitution edges
[2024/3/9 09:54:49] Sunaya: wait so what type of graph does it make?
‎[2024/3/9 09:55:24] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007486-PHOTO-2024-03-09-09-55-24.jpg>
[2024/3/9 09:56:53] Eric Gao: not diagnol jumps
[2024/3/9 09:57:05] Eric Gao: jumps are only vertical or horizontal
[2024/3/9 09:57:50] Sunaya: so except that it's correct?
[2024/3/9 09:58:06] Eric Gao: yea just remove all the diagnol edges
[2024/3/9 09:58:21] Sunaya: you mean diagonal jumps?
[2024/3/9 09:58:26] Eric Gao: and the edges
[2024/3/9 09:58:28] Sunaya: or all diagonal edges
[2024/3/9 09:58:40] Eric Gao: because you don't need them
‎[2024/3/9 09:59:15] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007495-PHOTO-2024-03-09-09-59-15.jpg>
[2024/3/9 09:59:55] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/3/9 10:11:23] Sunaya: I got n*(m-1) + m*(n-1)
[2024/3/9 10:12:25] Sunaya: If we’re saying that this is the graph
[2024/3/9 10:17:19] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/3/9 10:17:27] Eric Gao: try 4x4
[2024/3/9 10:21:05] Sunaya: Wait no
[2024/3/9 10:21:11] Sunaya: I finally fixed it
[2024/3/9 10:21:30] Sunaya: 4 nm - 3n - 3m
‎[2024/3/9 10:21:58] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007504-PHOTO-2024-03-09-10-21-58.jpg>
[2024/3/9 10:22:26] Sunaya: but for this m and n have to be greater than 2
[2024/3/9 10:27:27] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/3/9 10:30:36] Eric Gao: doesn't look right tho
[2024/3/9 10:31:00] Eric Gao: for each column, the first node has m edges to other nodes, the second has m-1, etc., and the last node has 0
[2024/3/9 10:31:33] Eric Gao: so for each column, the total number of edges is m(m+1)/2
[2024/3/9 10:31:46] Eric Gao: there are n columns, so the sum is n(m(m+1)/2)
[2024/3/9 10:31:57] Eric Gao: same case for rows, which sums to m(n(n+1)/2)
[2024/3/9 10:32:02] Eric Gao: so the final answer is their sum
[2024/3/9 10:33:55] Sunaya: does it work when you try some examples?
[2024/3/9 10:34:13] Eric Gao: try (m^2n+mn^2+2mn)/2
[2024/3/9 10:35:02] Eric Gao: oh wait should be offset by 1
[2024/3/9 10:35:23] Eric Gao: change the plus to minus
[2024/3/9 10:36:04] Eric Gao: so (m^2n+mn^2-2mn)/2
[2024/3/9 10:36:43] Eric Gao: yea this works for 3x3
[2024/3/9 10:50:37] Sunaya: no diagonal edges right
[2024/3/9 10:50:43] Eric Gao: y
[2024/3/9 10:50:45] Eric Gao: es
[2024/3/9 10:51:05] Sunaya: it works with this too => n (m-1) + m (n-1) + n(m-2) + m (n - 2)
[2024/3/9 10:51:57] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/3/9 11:17:47] Sunaya: what's Lorenzo's password again?
[2024/3/9 11:18:50] Eric Gao: 040821
[2024/3/9 11:28:02] Sunaya: i still need to look at 4 i wasted too much time for comp bio
[2024/3/9 11:28:10] Sunaya: if i have questions i'll ask you
[2024/3/9 11:29:52] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/3/10 14:15:38] Sunaya: Jesse
[2024/3/10 14:15:47] Eric Gao: What
[2024/3/10 14:15:56] Sunaya: jesus
[2024/3/10 14:16:02] Sunaya: How’s revision going
[2024/3/10 14:16:15] Eric Gao: I should know 80% of everything now
[2024/3/10 14:16:16] Sunaya: What are the four relation of need in atitude
[2024/3/10 14:16:41] Eric Gao: utilitarian, value need, social something, and something
[2024/3/10 14:17:21] Eric Gao: what are they
[2024/3/10 14:17:50] Sunaya: Social adjustive social identity value expression
[2024/3/10 14:17:56] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/3/10 14:18:10] Sunaya: Ussv
[2024/3/10 14:18:34] Eric Gao: ?
[2024/3/10 14:18:42] Sunaya: This
[2024/3/10 14:18:49] Eric Gao: ohok
[2024/3/10 14:18:51] Sunaya: U SS V
[2024/3/10 14:18:57] Eric Gao: you have acronym for everything?
[2024/3/10 14:19:11] Sunaya: Not really
[2024/3/10 14:19:23] Sunaya: Makes it easier to remember tho
[2024/3/10 14:19:42] Eric Gao: true that
[2024/3/10 14:21:10] Sunaya: Automaticity research techniques
[2024/3/10 14:21:22] Eric Gao: I know there’s two
[2024/3/10 14:21:27] Eric Gao: One is the go no go thing
[2024/3/10 14:21:43] Eric Gao: Other is the screen with female and engineer and stuff
[2024/3/10 14:21:59] Sunaya: Iat
[2024/3/10 14:22:09] Eric Gao: What
[2024/3/10 14:22:15] Sunaya: IAT
[2024/3/10 14:22:27] Sunaya: IMPLICIT ATTITUDE TASK
[2024/3/10 14:22:33] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/10 14:30:48] Sunaya: Consequences of self schema
[2024/3/10 14:30:57] Eric Gao: No idea about that one
[2024/3/10 14:31:07] Eric Gao: Self esteem?
‎[2024/3/10 14:31:14] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007560-PHOTO-2024-03-10-14-31-14.jpg>
[2024/3/10 14:31:14] Eric Gao: Wait no this is self concept
[2024/3/12 16:02:53] Sunaya: do you have extra mask?
[2024/3/12 16:03:01] Sunaya: I might need one tomorrow
[2024/3/12 21:54:00] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/3/12 21:54:09] Eric Gao: I’ll bring you one
[2024/3/13 00:59:46] Eric Gao: Come
[2024/3/14 13:08:47] Sunaya: I think your 5 is incorrect it doesn’t add up
[2024/3/14 13:09:06] Eric Gao: I know it doesn't
[2024/3/14 13:09:15] Sunaya: From v2 to v3 is 4
[2024/3/14 13:09:17] Eric Gao: give me a tree that adds up
[2024/3/14 13:09:24] Eric Gao: you can't because it's not additive
[2024/3/14 13:09:39] Sunaya: yea so shouldn’t that be the answer?
[2024/3/14 13:09:55] Eric Gao: follow the algorithm and lmk what you get
[2024/3/14 13:10:11] Eric Gao: I followed every step and every formula and that tree is what I got
[2024/3/14 13:12:03] Sunaya: should’ve put that on piazza
[2024/3/14 13:12:09] Sunaya: maybe she’d have removed this Qn
[2024/3/14 13:12:36] Eric Gao: wanna bet?
[2024/3/14 13:12:45] Eric Gao: I bet that my solution is correct
[2024/3/14 13:13:06] Sunaya: no betting haram
[2024/3/14 13:13:13] Sunaya: do you think your 4 is correct too?
[2024/3/14 13:13:18] Sunaya: I might bet on that
[2024/3/14 13:13:23] Eric Gao: let's bet
[2024/3/14 13:13:32] Eric Gao: 1 suckie
[2024/3/14 13:14:11] Sunaya: only for 4 tho
[2024/3/14 13:14:36] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/3/14 13:14:43] Sunaya: alright
[2024/3/14 14:12:28] Sunaya: ok there literally no solution
[2024/3/14 14:12:32] Sunaya: I’ll bet
[2024/3/14 14:12:37] Sunaya: for that too
[2024/3/14 14:18:10] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/14 14:18:12] Eric Gao: Deal
[2024/3/17 00:59:07] Eric Gao: Any updates from meeting yesterday?
[2024/3/17 01:47:05] Sunaya: we didn’t meet yesterday
[2024/3/17 01:48:27] Eric Gao: Oh
[2024/3/17 01:48:42] Eric Gao: How did you do 3b and 4
[2024/3/17 01:52:20] Sunaya: for 3b i did it similar to how you did it but i showed the probability of being fooled i.e at lest one of the options has to be wrong so probability of choosing all the not wrong ones/total options, which is less than 1. Therefore it is sound as it cna be repeated multiple times
[2024/3/17 01:52:54] Eric Gao: Did you have the exact probability?
[2024/3/17 01:53:51] Sunaya: yea I said one option has to be wrong so being fooled 27/28
[2024/3/17 01:54:13] Eric Gao: Oh ok
[2024/3/17 01:54:21] Sunaya: 4 is the same it’s just transitivity
[2024/3/17 01:54:26] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/17 01:54:36] Sunaya: also we need to work on comp bio today
[2024/3/17 01:54:44] Eric Gao: Oh yea
[2024/3/17 01:54:54] Eric Gao: I’m free after gti
[2024/3/17 01:55:15] Sunaya: I am too
[2024/3/17 01:55:35] Sunaya: the new coding assignment is due today btw
[2024/3/17 01:55:38] Sunaya: for comp bio
[2024/3/17 01:56:13] Eric Gao: Yea I did that
[2024/3/17 01:56:19] Eric Gao: Not too hard
[2024/3/17 01:56:19] Sunaya: Oh
[2024/3/17 01:56:31] Sunaya: it is hard tho
[2024/3/17 01:56:51] Eric Gao: The suffix tree one is hard
[2024/3/17 01:57:02] Eric Gao: Implementing it in python
[2024/3/17 01:57:36] Eric Gao: Gary helped
[2024/3/17 01:57:53] Sunaya: so it’s hard
[2024/3/17 01:57:57] Eric Gao: Actually you can find all these stuff online
[2024/3/17 01:59:24] Sunaya: did you do 210?
[2024/3/17 01:59:29] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/3/17 01:59:43] Sunaya: did you use table for make graph
[2024/3/17 01:59:49] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/17 01:59:51] Sunaya: or a different structure
[2024/3/17 01:59:54] Sunaya: just seq?
[2024/3/17 01:59:58] Eric Gao: I just used adjacency list
[2024/3/17 01:59:59] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/3/17 01:59:59] Sunaya: cause isn’t it nlogn
[2024/3/17 02:00:15] Sunaya: how did you make it n log n
[2024/3/17 02:00:21] Sunaya: NlogM
[2024/3/17 02:00:24] Eric Gao: I spent an hour and couldn’t think of a different one
[2024/3/17 02:00:54] Sunaya: I did the same but if you use table it become n log m instead of nlogn
[2024/3/17 02:01:04] Sunaya: yknow how in recitation he had a question
[2024/3/17 02:01:19] Sunaya: the only thing is idk how to do it like which structure will make it that
[2024/3/17 02:01:48] Sunaya: so you just did append and then collect and map
[2024/3/17 02:02:49] Eric Gao: I don’t remember this, but from edges to adjacency list had to be e log e, because we have to look at every edge
[2024/3/17 02:02:56] Eric Gao: Yes
[2024/3/17 02:03:07] Sunaya: yes but we need v log e
[2024/3/17 02:03:26] Eric Gao: Actually whatever method we use, we must look at every edge, which is already in e
[2024/3/17 02:03:33] Sunaya: from the handout
[2024/3/17 02:03:36] Eric Gao: I know
[2024/3/17 02:03:46] Sunaya: not really there’s a structure that’ll make it happen
[2024/3/17 02:04:01] Sunaya: it’s in the recitation slides
[2024/3/17 02:04:07] Sunaya: Wait let me show you
[2024/3/17 02:04:09] Eric Gao: Are you saying we don’t need to look at each edge from e?
[2024/3/17 02:04:20] Eric Gao: How do you insert everything then
[2024/3/17 02:04:27] Sunaya: I’m saying collect will be v log n
[2024/3/17 02:04:35] Eric Gao: Show me
[2024/3/17 02:04:42] Eric Gao: I don’t remember it at all
‎[2024/3/17 02:05:17] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007647-PHOTO-2024-03-17-02-05-17.jpg>
[2024/3/17 02:05:17] Sunaya: this
[2024/3/17 02:06:06] Eric Gao: Yea but you already have a table as input
[2024/3/17 02:06:20] Eric Gao: Which you already know there’s v vertices
[2024/3/17 02:06:41] Eric Gao: It’s O(n) work to get the number of vertices from a edge list
[2024/3/17 02:06:48] Eric Gao: O(e)
[2024/3/17 02:07:11] Eric Gao: Also this is elogv not vloge
[2024/3/17 02:07:12] Sunaya: does the handout say e log v or v log e
[2024/3/17 02:07:24] Eric Gao: I think elogv
[2024/3/17 02:10:07] Sunaya: I’ll go take a shower
[2024/3/17 02:10:10] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/17 02:10:26] Sunaya: but this works right?
[2024/3/17 02:10:40] Sunaya: convert from seq to table with collect and then do stuff and convert back to seq
[2024/3/17 02:10:43] Eric Gao: I don’t know. This is converting from a table to table
[2024/3/17 02:10:50] Eric Gao: Table has v entries
[2024/3/17 02:10:56] Eric Gao: Our edges list has e entries
[2024/3/17 02:11:19] Sunaya: yea but we want e log v
[2024/3/17 02:11:25] Sunaya: so append will be o e
[2024/3/17 02:11:31] Eric Gao: I don’t know if this code tells us we can convert edges to table in elogv
[2024/3/17 02:11:35] Sunaya: and then do collect on table
[2024/3/17 02:11:40] Eric Gao: Collect is eloge
[2024/3/17 02:12:00] Eric Gao: Because at this point we don’t have a table yet
[2024/3/17 02:12:20] Eric Gao: So collect will be on the edge list
[2024/3/17 02:33:45] Eric Gao: Let’s go
[2024/3/17 02:36:47] Eric Gao: See you on campus
[2024/3/17 02:38:18] Sunaya: Ok
[2024/3/17 06:09:33] Sunaya: are you back?
[2024/3/17 06:09:42] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/3/17 06:09:45] Sunaya: where do you wanna meet?
[2024/3/17 06:09:53] Sunaya: I come to your room?
[2024/3/17 06:09:58] Eric Gao: Ok sure
[2024/3/17 06:10:01] Eric Gao: After you eat come
[2024/3/17 06:10:06] Sunaya: Ok I’ll come once I eat
[2024/3/17 09:06:14] Sunaya: you said you did suffix trees right?
[2024/3/17 09:09:30] Eric Gao: Ye
[2024/3/17 09:09:42] Sunaya: ok
[2024/3/17 09:09:53] Sunaya: E R I C

[2024/3/17 09:31:20] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/3/17 09:31:26] Eric Gao: wtf
[2024/3/17 09:31:32] Eric Gao: also what happened with this
[2024/3/17 10:14:23] Eric Gao: check my code
[2024/3/17 10:14:32] Eric Gao: called dataAnalysis_local.py
[2024/3/17 10:15:01] Eric Gao: I'm using clinivar.vcf as the dbSNP file because they said this file has all the clinically significant variants
[2024/3/17 10:15:29] Eric Gao: but the bigger file GCF_000001405.25.gz is also there but I don't know its format
[2024/3/17 10:16:09] Eric Gao: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/README_VCF.txt
here is the readme file for the vcf file I downloaded ‎<这条消息已经过编辑>
[2024/3/17 11:02:07] Sunaya: did you find any clinical relevant when you ran it
[2024/3/17 11:05:10] Eric Gao: no
[2024/3/17 11:05:40] Eric Gao: that's why I asked you to see what's wrong
[2024/3/17 11:06:24] Sunaya: ok I’ll look at it
[2024/3/18 09:21:35] Sunaya: where you at
[2024/3/18 09:22:21] Eric Gao: meeting until 5
[2024/3/18 09:23:42] Sunaya: oh
[2024/3/18 09:30:34] Eric Gao: what time meeting tmr
‎[2024/3/18 09:30:47] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00007703-PHOTO-2024-03-18-09-30-47.jpg>

[2024/3/18 09:32:13] Sunaya: On Tuesday
[2024/3/18 09:32:38] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/3/18 09:32:59] Eric Gao: prof said she wants to push it to 2:45
[2024/3/18 09:33:22] Sunaya: But I have a meeting at 3
[2024/3/18 09:33:30] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/3/18 09:33:34] Eric Gao: what other time do you have
[2024/3/18 09:34:08] Sunaya: Wednesday 1 to 2?
[2024/3/18 09:34:19] Sunaya: or like after 4 on Tuesday
[2024/3/18 09:34:22] Eric Gao: check Madhavi's appointment link
[2024/3/18 09:34:25] Eric Gao: pick one for me
[2024/3/18 09:36:45] Sunaya: Choosing Wednesday 1-2
[2024/3/18 09:37:34] Sunaya: what’s your email
[2024/3/18 09:40:30] Sunaya: nvm done
[2024/3/18 09:56:51] Eric Gao: ok
‎[2024/3/18 18:05:11] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00007721-PHOTO-2024-03-18-18-05-11.jpg>
[2024/3/19 05:34:42] Eric Gao: Got food come foodcourt
[2024/3/19 05:37:38] Sunaya: what
[2024/3/19 05:48:04] Eric Gao: ‎语音通话, ‎36秒
[2024/3/19 05:57:07] Eric Gao: I have another meeting now
[2024/3/19 05:58:45] Sunaya: oh
[2024/3/19 05:58:50] Sunaya: give it to lorenzo
[2024/3/19 05:59:00] Sunaya: tell him to have it in his office i'll take it from his office
[2024/3/19 05:59:02] Eric Gao: He has a meetong
[2024/3/19 05:59:06] Sunaya: with who?
[2024/3/19 05:59:15] Eric Gao: His boss
[2024/3/19 05:59:20] Sunaya: where?
[2024/3/19 05:59:24] Sunaya: in his office
[2024/3/19 06:00:44] Sunaya: (2) Is this the right structure for the work this group does? Why or why not? (In other words, in what environments do you think this structure would be best suited for?)
[2024/3/19 06:07:42] Eric Gao: ?
[2024/3/19 09:13:05] Sunaya: I’m gonna take a nap now and look at the code
[2024/3/19 09:13:15] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/19 09:13:39] Sunaya: Also later tonight I’ll share a document on what we have to talk to Prof Madhavi about
[2024/3/19 09:13:50] Sunaya: Cause we need to go prepared this time on what to talk to her about
[2024/3/19 09:13:58] Sunaya: You in dorms
[2024/3/19 09:14:00] Sunaya: ‎语音通话, ‎5分钟
[2024/3/19 12:06:41] Sunaya: i looked at the code
[2024/3/19 12:07:08] Sunaya: lets say if we find a clinical significance for one of the positions then what are we doing after that
[2024/3/19 12:07:33] Eric Gao: writing that into a file
[2024/3/19 12:07:42] Sunaya: and after that
[2024/3/19 12:07:50] Eric Gao: that's it
[2024/3/19 12:08:03] Sunaya: no like waht after that
[2024/3/19 12:08:12] Eric Gao: just output a csv with all SNPs in palindromic regions with clinical significance
[2024/3/19 12:08:15] Sunaya: let's say we found some and then for the project what do we do next
[2024/3/19 12:09:33] Sunaya: i want to understand more about what exactly we are doing in the project and i feel like i have no idea
[2024/3/19 12:10:34] Eric Gao: hmm
[2024/3/19 12:10:52] Eric Gao: take a read of the project proposal and deliverable 2 and lmk if anything clarifies a bit
[2024/3/19 12:11:01] Eric Gao: I'll think about it later
[2024/3/19 12:12:40] Sunaya: alright
[2024/3/19 13:08:55] Sunaya: i kinda get it but like i don't see much work at least computationally, i feel like there's more work that goes on to literature review and than doing the computation cause most of the work finidng the palindromic regions and comparing it with SNPs is already done
[2024/3/19 13:09:15] Sunaya: and what if we don't find any clinical relevance
[2024/3/19 13:17:25] Eric Gao: Yea makes sense
[2024/3/19 13:17:41] Eric Gao: We look at if these variations occur at upstream of human genes
[2024/3/19 13:18:01] Eric Gao: Because palindromic regions are usually tf binding sites
[2024/3/19 13:50:26] Sunaya: yea you'll have to explain it to me before the meeting and I wanna help but i have no idea how to help
[2024/3/19 14:00:02] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/19 14:00:18] Eric Gao: For now we need to make sure what we're doing is correct
[2024/3/19 14:00:49] Eric Gao: We want to figure out which palindromic SNP already has identified clinical significance
[2024/3/19 14:02:19] Sunaya: i looked at the code i don't see anything wrong, we are only looking at one file so maybe there isn't any important stuff there. but i wanna know what we have to do if we don't fine any significance
[2024/3/19 14:02:25] Eric Gao: for those that wasn't, we need to figure out a way to see what gene upstream regions these map to
[2024/3/19 14:03:09] Eric Gao: that I have no idea. It's not likely that none of the SNPs have no clinical significance. If none of them have this then our code is probably doing something fishy
[2024/3/19 14:03:28] Sunaya: i see
[2024/3/21 07:17:04] Sunaya: Food is here finally
‎[2024/3/21 07:17:40] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007769-PHOTO-2024-03-21-07-17-40.jpg>

[2024/3/21 07:49:38] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/3/23 12:21:59] Eric Gao: did you do compbio?
[2024/3/24 01:54:32] Sunaya: nope
[2024/3/24 02:01:33] Eric Gao: damn
[2024/3/24 02:22:09] Sunaya: Did you?
[2024/3/24 02:22:16] Eric Gao: no
[2024/3/24 02:22:23] Sunaya: damn
[2024/3/24 07:27:30] Eric Gao: we didn't do stable matching right?
[2024/3/24 08:23:43] Sunaya: yea
[2024/3/25 01:03:00] Eric Gao: Gogogo
[2024/3/25 01:18:37] Sunaya: just woke up
[2024/3/25 01:25:49] Eric Gao: Damn

[2024/3/26 06:28:10] Sunaya: i spenta ll this time only to realize that the meeting was next week
[2024/3/26 06:28:26] Sunaya: i had so much other work and i spent on this stupid thing
[2024/3/26 07:17:50] Eric Gao: Damn
[2024/3/26 08:38:01] Sunaya: eric
[2024/3/26 08:38:05] Sunaya: Did you submit comp bio
[2024/3/26 08:51:42] Eric Gao: shoot no
[2024/3/26 13:34:47] Sunaya: did you do it now?
[2024/3/26 13:34:55] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/3/26 13:35:36] Sunaya: also what happened to the photo on the back of your phone
[2024/3/26 13:35:50] Eric Gao: What’s your guess
[2024/3/26 13:36:21] Sunaya: you got a new case and forgot to put it back
[2024/3/26 13:36:28] Eric Gao: Guess again
[2024/3/26 13:36:45] Sunaya: you lost it while you changed cases
[2024/3/26 13:36:52] Eric Gao: Guess again
[2024/3/26 13:37:18] Sunaya: you got tired of the same photo so you put it somewhere for now
[2024/3/26 13:37:25] Eric Gao: Guess again
[2024/3/26 13:37:50] Sunaya: you wanted your case to have a breath of fresh air
[2024/3/26 13:38:11] Eric Gao: Guess again
[2024/3/26 13:38:20] Sunaya: the picture on it didn’t suit your recent fashion style. it looked better without the photos
[2024/3/26 13:38:36] Eric Gao: Somewhat closer. Guess again
[2024/3/26 13:38:39] Sunaya: you wanted to be able to see the color of your iPhone again
[2024/3/26 13:38:48] Eric Gao: No. Guess again
[2024/3/26 13:39:19] Sunaya: you wanted to see if I’d ask so you removed it for a week or so
[2024/3/26 13:39:27] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/26 13:39:54] Sunaya: you made a bet with someone and you lost so you had it removed for a certain amount of time
[2024/3/26 13:39:59] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/26 13:40:26] Sunaya: while you were jerking off it may have got inside and you’re washing it and letting it dry off rn
[2024/3/26 13:40:31] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/26 13:41:04] Sunaya: you don’t want orher ppl to see it so you don’t have it in there anymore
[2024/3/26 13:41:26] Eric Gao: Close but no
[2024/3/26 13:41:29] Sunaya: you don’t want ppl always asking what’s in the case so you removed it
[2024/3/26 13:41:36] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/26 13:41:56] Sunaya: you forgot why it’s not in there anymore
[2024/3/26 13:42:05] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/26 13:42:24] Eric Gao: I’m gonna shower now, keep guessing
[2024/3/26 13:42:34] Sunaya: prof Madhavi asked you to remove it
[2024/3/26 13:43:20] Sunaya: you do know what this is a NP no even higher cause there’s infinite possibilities
[2024/3/26 13:50:21] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/26 13:50:31] Eric Gao: Not really
[2024/3/26 13:50:41] Sunaya: prof christos asked you to remove it
[2024/3/26 13:50:49] Eric Gao: No one asked me to remove iy
[2024/3/26 13:50:59] Sunaya: Prof Giselle said if you remove it I’ll make you functional CA
[2024/3/26 13:51:47] Sunaya: you removed it cause a pebble fell over
[2024/3/26 13:51:55] Sunaya: ? what is it ?
[2024/3/26 13:52:07] Sunaya: was that correct you didn’t say no
[2024/3/26 13:52:56] Sunaya: ??
[2024/3/26 13:53:12] Eric Gao: No
[2024/3/26 13:53:20] Eric Gao: Don’t know what you mean but no
[2024/3/26 13:53:38] Sunaya: So you gonna say or not?
[2024/3/26 13:53:53] Sunaya: where’s the resolve
[2024/3/26 13:54:07] Eric Gao: I’m pretty sure you know
[2024/3/26 13:54:16] Sunaya: no
[2024/3/26 13:54:27] Sunaya: I just guess and none of it was true
[2024/3/26 13:55:12] Sunaya: also what did you use for cb the networks
[2024/3/26 13:55:25] Sunaya: and GTI hw is out what did you get

[2024/3/28 06:57:52] Eric Gao: compared to professors here
[2024/3/28 06:58:01] Sunaya: extremely good
[2024/3/28 06:58:05] Sunaya: Better than most prof here
[2024/3/28 06:58:09] Eric Gao: damn
[2024/3/28 06:58:40] Sunaya: I could see why prof khaled and other prof were talking so highly of him
[2024/3/28 06:58:54] Eric Gao: yea

[2024/4/10 08:47:04] Eric Gao: ok message me when you leave
[2024/4/10 08:47:10] Sunaya: ok
[2024/4/10 08:47:22] Eric Gao: 12 angry men is very difficult to watch
[2024/4/10 08:47:27] Sunaya: it’s not
[2024/4/10 08:47:28] Eric Gao: you can't understand anything
[2024/4/10 08:47:31] Sunaya: it’s very interesting
[2024/4/10 08:47:32] Eric Gao: the audio is so bad
[2024/4/10 08:47:50] Sunaya: watch it from other movie sites with caption
[2024/4/10 08:47:59] Eric Gao: probably yea
[2024/4/10 08:48:13] Sunaya: I finished it and it was actually very good and interesting
[2024/4/10 08:48:31] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/4/10 08:48:56] Sunaya: we’re leaving at 4
[2024/4/10 08:49:08] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/11 20:11:06] Sunaya: we work on comp bio half Friday and Saturday okay
[2024/4/11 20:11:18] Sunaya: full Saturday half Friday
[2024/4/12 00:22:44] Eric Gao: Saturday madhavi needs me for morning
[2024/4/12 00:22:49] Eric Gao: But today let’s work
[2024/4/12 03:25:05] Eric Gao: this morning I tried again to fix the code. I extended the checking to +-3 of the palindrome range, I updated the clinvar file to the correct reference genome (hg19, it was hg38 before), and things still didn't seem to work well
[2024/4/12 03:31:18] Eric Gao: I went on table browser and found a few files we can use. I downloaded them into the folder on sirius:
1. microsatellite_regulation.tsv: this file has microsatellites in human genome, which are important biological indicators for evaluating gene expression. it's known that they are more likely to mutate, so we can see whether palindrome mutations are more likely to occur in these places compared to regular mutations. Prof. Madhavi's paper also mentioned they should've done some study related to that
2. gwas_catalog_functions.tsv: this file contains all the studied human genes and their positions, and we're interested in their "trait" - disease/functions they are correlated with. 
3. enhancers_regulation.tsv: this file contains all the enhancers (regulatory regions in human genome where methylation can happen and therefore increase the expression of some genes)
4. domain_uniprot_function.tsv: this file is similar to GWAS, describing how proteins are mapped to human genomes.
5. tss_peaks_regulation.tsv: this file contains all the transcription starting sites (TSS) and how much they are expressed in human cells. this can be an indicator of whether palindromic mutations are affecting important mechanisms

if you want to see their specifications, go to https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables, then change the "group" to "All Tracks", then find the track with the most similar name, then click "data format description". ‎<这条消息已经过编辑>
[2024/4/12 06:42:29] Eric Gao: I need to leave now, but try to see the specifications for these files. We’re interested in finding more information about these palindrome SNPs: are they more predictive/influential in genetic disruptions? Are they showing a pattern in terms of where they occur? Or other interesting questions people haven’t studied much yet
[2024/4/12 07:39:25] Sunaya: alright
[2024/4/12 07:39:42] Sunaya: I’ll look at it today
[2024/4/12 07:40:00] Sunaya: I just got off from bed
[2024/4/12 07:40:10] Eric Gao: ok
‎[2024/4/12 14:08:49] Sunaya:‎<附件：00007974-PHOTO-2024-04-12-14-08-49.jpg>
[2024/4/12 14:09:11] Sunaya: idk if this implies anything but at least it's not zero
[2024/4/12 14:09:34] Sunaya: I'll try to look at the other files and see what happens and upload it in sirius
[2024/4/12 14:40:06] Eric Gao: This looks quite interesting. To know what it implies, we might also need to know what’s the expected number if it happened at random (using the total length of palindromes, total length of enhancers, and total length of genome, and calculate the expected number of palindromes that map to enhancers)
[2024/4/12 14:41:08] Eric Gao: You wasn’t able to run code on sirius?
[2024/4/12 14:41:23] Sunaya: i don't like running in it cause i can't use VS code
[2024/4/12 14:41:38] Eric Gao: I think you still can, use the ssh extension
[2024/4/12 14:41:48] Sunaya: oh yea right
[2024/4/12 21:47:18] Sunaya: are you gonna go to the volleyball dinner? I’m doing whatever you decide to do
[2024/4/13 00:25:38] Eric Gao: No volleyball
[2024/4/13 03:12:04] Sunaya: no I mean the dinner
[2024/4/13 03:24:59] Eric Gao: No
[2024/4/13 03:25:04] Eric Gao: No going out with volleyball
[2024/4/13 03:25:14] Sunaya: alright me no going too
[2024/4/13 08:56:32] Sunaya: turn down for what🧍
[2024/4/13 08:57:10] Eric Gao: Happy new year
[2024/4/13 08:57:28] Sunaya: thank you
[2024/4/13 08:57:32] Sunaya: first person to say it
[2024/4/13 08:57:54] Eric Gao: What do you usually do in Nepali new year
[2024/4/13 08:59:09] Sunaya: nothing really just hang out with family maybe travel like to a resort or smt eat food
[2024/4/13 08:59:39] Eric Gao: Wanna eat dinner?
[2024/4/13 09:00:03] Sunaya: yea also we can go to katara there’s going to be fireworks
[2024/4/13 09:00:06] Eric Gao: Is there a good nepali restaurant
[2024/4/13 09:00:27] Eric Gao: Yea I went al wakra yesterday there was also fireworks
[2024/4/13 09:00:36] Sunaya: oh damn I see
[2024/4/13 09:00:54] Sunaya: I know of Nepali restaurants idk if they are good or not though
[2024/4/13 09:01:19] Eric Gao: We can go try and then go to katara
[2024/4/13 09:01:33] Sunaya: yea I’ll ask Haolin and the others too
[2024/4/13 09:01:37] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/4/13 09:20:25] Sunaya: haolin said he going too and prolly Lorenzo too but since it's at like 8-9, what if we eat food at the cafeteria? you could say it's nepali made by fellow nepali
[2024/4/13 09:20:54] Sunaya: hailin want to eat in cafeteria
[2024/4/13 09:23:18] Sunaya: i'm fine with anything but we 100% going to see fireworks
[2024/4/13 09:23:30] Sunaya: cause i'm never seen fireworks
[2024/4/13 09:23:42] Eric Gao: Ok sure
[2024/4/13 09:23:49] Eric Gao: Cafeteria is ok
[2024/4/13 09:24:15] Sunaya: alright cafeteria then we go to katara or where they do fireworks later and maybe we can get desert or icecream there
[2024/4/13 09:24:19] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/4/13 09:24:21] Sunaya: while we look at the fireworks
[2024/4/13 09:34:53] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/4/13 10:47:35] Sunaya: so I think we will eat out and then watch the fireworks in the souq
[2024/4/13 10:51:04] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/4/13 10:51:17] Eric Gao: When you leave?
[2024/4/13 10:51:27] Sunaya: Lorenzo's coming back rn so ig we'll leave in a few mins
[2024/4/13 10:51:37] Eric Gao: What food you eating
[2024/4/13 10:51:47] Sunaya: no idea
[2024/4/13 10:52:18] Eric Gao: I had lunch with madhavi (indian food) and I wanted to poop but it went away
[2024/4/13 10:52:28] Sunaya: lol
[2024/4/13 10:52:31] Sunaya: what did you eat
[2024/4/13 10:52:34] Eric Gao: I don’t know if I should leave before I poop

[2024/4/14 18:04:38] Sunaya: Eric
[2024/4/14 18:05:21] Sunaya: you want to start working on writing the paper for comp bio in overleaf
[2024/4/14 18:05:51] Sunaya: I’ll try to find a good template and share it with you
[2024/4/14 18:07:24] Sunaya: also we should prolly finish 90 percent of it by this week, we cna work on it for an hour each day or smt like that. im mostly free now considering we won’t have 210, comp bio, social psych hw anymore
[2024/4/15 00:16:02] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/16 02:06:50] Eric Gao: I shared overleaf with you last night, the template looks good
[2024/4/16 02:47:58] Sunaya: I don’t have overleaf on my Andrew email it’s only for sunayau@gmail.com
[2024/4/16 02:48:07] Eric Gao: okie
[2024/4/16 02:48:31] Eric Gao: sent
[2024/4/16 03:33:03] Sunaya: I so wanna sleep more and my sleep keeps getting disrupted
[2024/4/16 03:35:16] Eric Gao: just wake up
[2024/4/16 03:35:24] Eric Gao: if you can't sleep
[2024/4/16 04:35:51] Sunaya: ih shit the thing is out
[2024/4/16 05:10:30] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/4/16 06:16:43] Sunaya: okay I’m finally free now
[2024/4/16 06:20:24] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/16 06:20:49] Sunaya: Did you do the bonus btw I didn’t do it
[2024/4/16 06:20:57] Sunaya: I barely had enough time to completely finish all
[2024/4/16 06:23:31] Sunaya: I’ll start looking at the overleaf and her comment starting at 1:45
[2024/4/16 06:23:51] Eric Gao: didn't do bonus
[2024/4/16 06:24:03] Eric Gao: I have meeting at 1:30-2:30
[2024/4/16 06:24:11] Eric Gao: not too many comments tbh
[2024/4/16 06:24:15] Sunaya: Oh really
[2024/4/16 06:24:16] Sunaya: Damn
[2024/4/16 06:54:55] Sunaya: Apparently we have to use the template she provided in piazza
[2024/4/16 07:01:30] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/4/16 07:01:35] Eric Gao: we change some titles
[2024/4/16 07:01:50] Sunaya: oh so we don't have to use it it just has to be similar
[2024/4/16 07:02:10] Eric Gao: she didn't give any tex file or format, just the sections we should include ig
[2024/4/16 08:12:28] Eric Gao: did you put your code to Sirius?
[2024/4/16 08:14:11] Eric Gao: also did you look at prof's feedback?
[2024/4/16 09:21:45] Sunaya: yea that’s
[2024/4/16 09:21:49] Sunaya: Ye it’s there
[2024/4/16 09:24:42] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/4/16 09:25:41] Sunaya: I hate today
[2024/4/16 09:25:49] Eric Gao: Why what happened
[2024/4/16 09:25:54] Sunaya: it’s like a break but the worst one
[2024/4/16 09:25:56] Eric Gao: You were sleeping?
[2024/4/16 09:26:10] Sunaya: yea but then I can’t seem to properly sleep
[2024/4/16 09:26:18] Eric Gao: Huh why tho
[2024/4/16 09:26:33] Sunaya: I just want rest and no matter when I sleep I just wake up or like have to wake up
[2024/4/16 09:26:57] Eric Gao: You took pill?
[2024/4/16 09:27:08] Sunaya: oh shit I forgot
[2024/4/16 09:27:08] Eric Gao: Drink enough water?
[2024/4/16 09:27:15] Eric Gao: Eat enough food?
[2024/4/16 09:27:20] Eric Gao: Pooped? Peed?
[2024/4/16 09:27:39] Sunaya: prolly this too I ran out of water need to get some today
[2024/4/16 09:27:50] Eric Gao: You can order on talabat
[2024/4/16 09:31:21] Sunaya: you wanna meet now
[2024/4/16 09:31:25] Sunaya: and work on comp bio
[2024/4/16 09:31:38] Eric Gao: Nows not a good time
[2024/4/16 09:32:12] Sunaya: why does this sound liek you're jerking off rn and like "mate now's not the right time i'm about to cum"
[2024/4/16 09:32:21] Eric Gao: Work on something now, and I’ll work later
[2024/4/16 09:32:26] Eric Gao: Nah not jerking off
[2024/4/16 09:32:38] Eric Gao: Why would I be texting you if I’m jerking off
[2024/4/16 09:42:34] Sunaya: i'm gonna go for food rn, i'll change the code to get the expectation to know what the numbers imply  and put whatever we have so far in the doc
[2024/4/16 09:42:51] Sunaya: if you're free haolin and Lorenzo said go out food in mall?
[2024/4/16 09:43:02] Sunaya: if you want, and you're free leaving rn
[2024/4/16 11:32:07] Eric Gao: Sorry didn’t read message, have fun!
[2024/4/16 15:03:34] Sunaya: are you asleep?
[2024/4/16 15:18:45] Sunaya: how would you look at all the rows in the file cause just looking at 100000 takes so long
[2024/4/16 15:49:35] Sunaya: are you free tomorrow after 4 PM my class ends at 3:45 for OB, we can stay on campus and work on comp bio until we finish and submit?

[2024/4/17 15:09:20] Sunaya: In conclusion, our study presents a thorough exploration into the role of palindromic SNPs in gene regulation within the human genome. Palindromic regions, characterized by symmetrical sequences, emerge as pivotal sites for transcription factor binding, thereby influencing gene expression patterns. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of understanding the functional consequences of palindromic SNPs in human biology. By shedding light on the functional consequences of palindromic SNPs, our research opens up new avenues for further exploration in the realms of genetics.

‎[2024/4/21 12:53:43] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00008193-PHOTO-2024-04-21-12-53-43.jpg>
[2024/4/21 12:58:00] Sunaya: alright
[2024/4/21 12:58:28] Eric Gao: and I'll do slides 1-5, you do 6-10, and slide 8 we can share
[2024/4/21 13:13:04] Sunaya: how did you put the curly brackets
[2024/4/21 13:13:07] Sunaya: like befoe
[2024/4/21 13:13:23] Eric Gao: insert shapes equations
[2024/4/21 13:31:24] Sunaya: also I might need to use a sheet with text while doing the presentation cause I might forget
[2024/4/21 13:31:40] Sunaya: you’re prolly not using anything right?
[2024/4/21 13:31:57] Eric Gao: yea I won't
[2024/4/21 13:32:41] Sunaya: why not
[2024/4/21 13:46:00] Eric Gao: why do I need it
[2024/4/21 13:46:14] Sunaya: nope
[2024/4/21 14:01:59] Eric Gao: ok I'm done with my part
[2024/4/21 14:02:06] Eric Gao: you wanna practice now?
[2024/4/21 14:02:42] Sunaya: i'm not done with my part yet plus i need to look up a bit to practice so might need a bit more time
[2024/4/21 14:02:49] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/21 14:02:57] Sunaya: but i'm fine with doing in the morning too
[2024/4/21 14:03:02] Eric Gao: sure
[2024/4/21 14:03:05] Sunaya: cause it might take a while for me and you sleep at 10
[2024/4/21 14:03:13] Sunaya: what time in the morning tho
[2024/4/21 14:03:22] Eric Gao: morning I can only do 6:30-7
[2024/4/21 14:03:29] Sunaya: alright
[2024/4/21 14:03:30] Eric Gao: or 7:30-8 if everything goes well
[2024/4/21 14:04:01] Sunaya: i'll try to finish everyhitn by night if there's time we can practice at night otherwise we can do morning
[2024/4/21 14:04:10] Sunaya: also what do we upload for the final report
[2024/4/21 14:04:20] Sunaya: cause she didn't give any feedback we wouldn't know what to change
[2024/4/21 14:04:37] Eric Gao: yea we can't really submit before she gives any feedback
[2024/4/21 14:04:48] Sunaya: and when do you wanna submit the ppt?
[2024/4/21 14:05:03] Eric Gao: whenever you finish
[2024/4/21 14:06:59] Eric Gao: and yea for slide 7 it's better if it's a flowchart
[2024/4/21 14:07:23] Eric Gao: https://app.diagrams.net/
try to make one with this if you have time
[2024/4/21 14:07:34] Sunaya: i was gonna make a flow chart but i felt like it wouldnt' fit
[2024/4/21 14:07:47] Eric Gao: hmm makes sense
[2024/4/21 14:08:18] Sunaya: so it's technically flowchar goes from top to bottom the blue ones and each blue one goes to the side
[2024/4/21 14:08:42] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/21 14:08:48] Eric Gao: green too much text
[2024/4/21 14:08:54] Eric Gao: bullet point it
[2024/4/21 14:10:49] Eric Gao: and also when you're done go over the grading rubric on piazza post
[2024/4/21 14:11:17] Sunaya: okay
[2024/4/21 14:11:25] Sunaya: i'm trying to reduce it
[2024/4/21 14:11:42] Eric Gao: how long do you think you'll need? cuz if it's not too long then I'll stay awake and do something on your slides
[2024/4/21 14:13:02] Sunaya: i'm thinking of rereding the paper and look some stuff up after i finish the slides
[2024/4/21 14:13:25] Sunaya: time might vart and i don't wanna keep you at it since i don't know exactly how long it'll take
[2024/4/21 14:13:56] Sunaya: i can prolly finish the slides by 9:30 but i might need longer to practice the presentaiotn
[2024/4/21 14:15:46] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/21 14:16:08] Eric Gao: I'll think about the design and stuff then
[2024/4/21 14:23:57] Sunaya: do we leave the contribution slide as it is?
[2024/4/21 14:24:10] Eric Gao: yea that we don't need to change any
[2024/4/21 14:24:30] Eric Gao: or if you want sure but I don't know what to change there
[2024/4/21 14:24:38] Sunaya: also the finding and stuff does the thing I've written make sense i'll try to write a shorter version of it on the green ones
[2024/4/21 14:24:48] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/21 14:25:31] Eric Gao: in the paper results section, before each figure I wrote something like palindromes are correlated with enhancers or something like that
[2024/4/21 14:25:39] Eric Gao: you can put those as part of the conclusion
[2024/4/21 14:25:56] Sunaya: as part of key findings?
[2024/4/21 14:26:04] Eric Gao: ye
[2024/4/21 14:26:12] Sunaya: are the imporantce and implications okay?
[2024/4/21 14:26:57] Eric Gao: not really
[2024/4/21 14:27:08] Eric Gao: these aren't really what we're doing I think
[2024/4/21 14:27:19] Eric Gao: we're mainly doing gene regulation
[2024/4/21 14:28:34] Sunaya: but that would still help for personal medication right?
[2024/4/21 14:29:21] Eric Gao: yea, but what's there is a bit too general. for this to be helping personal medication, we should talk about medication that targets these palindromic regulatory regions
[2024/4/21 14:30:27] Sunaya: oh i see
[2024/4/21 14:30:53] Sunaya: but can't include too much there tho, so i'll try to put something general and explain during the presentiaion ig
[2024/4/21 14:31:35] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/21 14:46:56] Sunaya: i think i'm done with the slides
[2024/4/21 14:47:06] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/21 14:47:16] Sunaya: look through it and we can submit
[2024/4/21 14:47:20] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/4/21 14:53:52] Eric Gao: ok ig it looks fine

[2024/4/22 00:09:01] Eric Gao: The rest looks fine to me
[2024/4/22 00:11:57] Sunaya: Oh okay
[2024/4/22 00:12:45] Eric Gao: Yea cuz these two are functional analysis directly relating to gene expression, the other three are more about regulation region
[2024/4/22 00:12:58] Sunaya: alright
[2024/4/22 00:14:45] Eric Gao: Did you try how long you can say all those?
[2024/4/22 00:20:10] Sunaya: depending on how long it takes when I actually speak I might cut some stuff

[2024/4/23 12:11:38] Sunaya: what you gonna book next year for housing?
[2024/4/23 12:11:46] Eric Gao: booked the same room
[2024/4/23 12:11:51] Sunaya: i'm thinking karam or amanah
[2024/4/23 12:11:55] Sunaya: wait what why?
[2024/4/23 12:12:06] Eric Gao: cuz it's nice room and I wanna cook
[2024/4/23 12:12:12] Sunaya: did you actually cook tho this sem?
[2024/4/23 12:12:14] Sunaya: or the prev one
[2024/4/23 12:12:32] Eric Gao: ye
[2024/4/23 12:12:38] Sunaya: and isn't it a bit too far coulve chosen thekeai
[2024/4/23 12:12:41] Eric Gao: cooked around 2-3 times per week
[2024/4/23 12:12:55] Sunaya: oh damn that's a lot
[2024/4/23 12:13:20] Sunaya: what do you usually cook cause i tried cooking and it started being the same things and i got fed up and there's too much cleaning and stuff
[2024/4/23 12:13:37] Eric Gao: just insta noodles and steak usually, sometimes rice with meatball soup
[2024/4/23 12:13:48] Sunaya: so it not get boring
[2024/4/23 12:13:54] Sunaya: having the same thing
[2024/4/23 12:14:00] Eric Gao: 2-3 times per week is ok
[2024/4/23 12:14:25] Sunaya: i see
[2024/4/23 12:14:31] Sunaya: alright then
[2024/4/23 12:14:49] Sunaya: i might book karam or Amanah depending on who's going where

[2024/4/24 07:19:27] Eric Gao: I plan to add 2 things to our report
[2024/4/24 07:20:21] Eric Gao: we need a short review of enhancers and microsatellites, including what they are, how they are related to transcription/gene regulation, and if they are related to palindromes talk about that too
[2024/4/24 07:20:55] Eric Gao: I've added some figures to the paper also, and I'll add a few things in the result section. do you think you can do the enhancers and microsatellites? ‎<这条消息已经过编辑>
[2024/4/24 07:38:02] Sunaya: yea

[2024/4/24 07:50:14] Eric Gao: the citation numbers you can start numbering from 1
[2024/4/24 07:50:29] Eric Gao: I'll put your stuff in, adjust the citation numbers, and submit

[2024/4/24 07:51:54] Eric Gao: sure take your time
[2024/4/24 09:15:44] Sunaya: Enhancers

Enhancers are short (typically 50-1500 base pairs) non-coding DNA sequences that play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression [3]. They exert their influence over gene transcription by binding to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins . Enhancers function as cis-acting regulatory elements that can modulate gene expression over long distances. By interacting with specific transcription factors, enhancers can enhance or suppress gene transcription in a tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner [5,6].

Microsatellites 

Microsatellites, also known as short tandem repeats (STRs) or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are repetitive DNA sequences consisting of 1-6 base pair motifs repeated in tandem [2].  These sequences are highly polymorphic and can vary in length due to slippage during DNA replication [2].While traditionally considered as non-functional, recent studies have implicated microsatellites in various aspects of gene regulation. Microsatellites can affect gene expression by modulating chromatin structure, DNA methylation patterns, and transcription factor binding [1,4]

[2024/5/2 00:27:07] Eric Gao: what did you do for this one
[2024/5/2 00:38:38] Sunaya: I said you basically run dijkstra with the k special nodes, dijkstra then gives you a table and you use that to find what’s needed
[2024/5/2 00:38:59] Eric Gao: I was thinking the same, but wouldn't it do too much work?
[2024/5/2 00:39:30] Sunaya: I was thinking it was gonna me more work but apparently the prof also said this is right
[2024/5/2 00:39:58] Eric Gao: I was thinking that you make k copies of the graph, link the k special nodes across with edges, and run Dijkstra from one source
[2024/5/2 00:40:17] Eric Gao: to get the distance you do a subtraction
[2024/5/2 00:40:32] Eric Gao: oh ok then
[2024/5/2 00:40:54] Sunaya: what would the work and span be for second
[2024/5/2 00:41:04] Sunaya: what type of table does dijkstra return
[2024/5/2 00:42:14] Eric Gao: think it returns a set of (v, d) where v is each vertex and d is the distance
[2024/5/2 00:42:49] Eric Gao: think lookup should be logn
[2024/5/2 00:43:01] Sunaya: both span and work?
[2024/5/2 00:43:31] Eric Gao: for sets I think s
‎[2024/5/2 00:53:27] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00008473-PHOTO-2024-05-02-00-53-27.jpg>
[2024/5/2 00:59:58] Sunaya: for a and b heaps with m and n nodes, their meld would give log(m + n + 1) not what that is saying which is addition of logs
[2024/5/2 01:00:33] Eric Gao: right.. I remember that now

[2024/5/2 01:01:32] Sunaya: The independent set one
[2024/5/2 01:02:02] Eric Gao: yea I got 1/(deg+1) for b
[2024/5/2 01:02:31] Eric Gao: and n/(d+1)
[2024/5/2 01:03:32] Sunaya: yup
[2024/5/2 01:42:06] Sunaya: I think this should be nd/d + 1
[2024/5/2 01:42:49] Sunaya: Because when a vertex is the highest we also remove the neighbors
[2024/5/2 01:43:18] Sunaya: but yea we don’t know how many neighbors it has and it wouldn’t necessarily have d neighbors
[2024/5/2 01:43:26] Sunaya: So yea ig this is the upper bound
[2024/5/2 02:02:08] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/5/2 02:48:01] Sunaya: whats the final proper answer of the palindrome one the a and e cause ppl saying diff stuff
[2024/5/2 02:54:34] Eric Gao: the question is essentially asking what's the minimum number of palindromes that partition a string. let dp[i] indicate the min number of palindrome partitions in s[0:i]. if s[0:i] is palindrome, then this would be 1. Otherwise, find the last palindrome before i, add 1 to the dp value before this palindrome, in other words min (0<=j<i) (dp[j]+1) for all j such that s[j+1:i] is palindrome
[2024/5/2 03:00:04] Sunaya: Oh I see
[2024/5/2 03:00:08] Sunaya: Thanks
[2024/5/2 03:00:22] Eric Gao: np
[2024/5/2 03:00:30] Sunaya: my c is correct right it’s at the bottom
[2024/5/2 03:03:28] Eric Gao: Yea looks right
[2024/5/2 03:03:52] Sunaya: the base is (O,n)
[2024/5/2 03:04:08] Eric Gao: Wdym the base
[2024/5/2 03:04:13] Eric Gao: For c?
[2024/5/2 03:04:34] Eric Gao: (0,n) is what you call to compute all the numbers
[2024/5/2 03:05:01] Sunaya: yea the call I mean
[2024/5/2 03:05:30] Sunaya: but how does it give all the substring
[2024/5/2 03:06:23] Eric Gao: Hmmm
[2024/5/2 03:07:02] Eric Gao: Let’s say n=6, how do you get 3,5
[2024/5/2 03:07:21] Eric Gao: You need 4,4
[2024/5/2 03:07:28] Eric Gao: Which is a base case
[2024/5/2 03:07:53] Eric Gao: Ok actually I don’t think calling 0,n computes all substrings
[2024/5/2 03:09:10] Eric Gao: I think you can do 0,i where i goes to n, and j,n where j starts from 0
[2024/5/2 03:09:19] Eric Gao: There would be O(n) calls
[2024/5/2 03:09:26] Eric Gao: Each call is linear
[2024/5/2 03:25:57] Sunaya: alright I’ll write this down properly and show you
[2024/5/2 03:26:05] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/5/3 11:37:00] Eric Gao: what did you get for social psych
[2024/5/3 12:32:21] Sunaya: Haven’t looked yet
[2024/5/3 12:33:34] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/5/4 16:26:25] Sunaya: 24.5
[2024/5/4 20:08:33] Eric Gao: Damn same
[2024/5/4 20:08:42] Sunaya: oh nice
[2024/5/4 20:09:31] Eric Gao: Why you awake
[2024/5/4 20:10:28] Sunaya: coincidence
[2024/5/4 20:11:27] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/5/6 05:42:14] Eric Gao: prof madhavi asks if you want to prepare an abstract for the compbio report we did so that we can submit to a conference before May 20
[2024/5/6 05:45:41] Sunaya: sure
[2024/5/6 05:46:08] Sunaya: by when do you want to finding the abstract
[2024/5/6 05:48:06] Eric Gao: prof said she's gonna give us feedback by tomorrow, and we prepare a draft by the end of this week
[2024/5/6 05:48:23] Sunaya: okay sounds good
[2024/5/6 05:49:13] Eric Gao: good
[2024/5/6 08:38:33] Sunaya: are you getting an A in gti?
[2024/5/6 08:50:59] Eric Gao: 84.6%
[2024/5/6 08:54:54] Sunaya: what was your score for final
[2024/5/6 08:55:07] Eric Gao: 87 something
[2024/5/6 08:55:35] Sunaya: oh I see
[2024/5/6 08:55:54] Sunaya: I managed to get an a in 210 so you’ll prolly get one in gti
[2024/5/6 08:56:17] Eric Gao: don't think so
[2024/5/6 08:57:18] Eric Gao: christos doesn't curve that much
[2024/5/6 08:57:43] Eric Gao: especially because of the people who got high in mt2
[2024/5/6 08:57:52] Eric Gao: with some illegal help
[2024/5/6 09:02:20] Sunaya: I mean the ppl who got high in mt2 prolly got super low
[2024/5/6 09:02:29] Eric Gao: yea ik
[2024/5/6 09:02:41] Eric Gao: but I don't think A curve can be this low
[2024/5/6 09:02:50] Sunaya: true
[2024/5/6 09:03:06] Eric Gao: are you coming to graduation tonight?
[2024/5/6 09:03:16] Sunaya: yknow I thought I wouldn’t get too high but all the questions I did I got full
[2024/5/6 09:03:38] Sunaya: idk I’m on cmapus rn but I might not stay for graduation
[2024/5/6 09:04:05] Sunaya: there’s really no point there’ll be too many ppl and I don’t want to join
[2024/5/6 09:04:17] Sunaya: it’s the same all the time
[2024/5/6 09:04:40] Eric Gao: that's nice
[2024/5/6 09:04:52] Eric Gao: ok makes sense
[2024/5/6 09:09:52] Sunaya: are you going for graduation?
[2024/5/6 09:10:20] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/5/6 09:10:30] Sunaya: oh you’re volunteering?
[2024/5/6 09:10:49] Sunaya: ‎这条消息已被删除。
[2024/5/6 09:11:02] Sunaya: or you’re j coming in
[2024/5/6 09:12:20] Eric Gao: j coming
[2024/5/7 03:44:53] Eric Gao: You want a broom and mop?
[2024/5/7 03:57:22] Sunaya: whose broom and mop
[2024/5/7 04:03:30] Eric Gao: Mine
[2024/5/7 04:23:44] Sunaya: but im leaving too
[2024/5/7 04:23:50] Sunaya: and I wouldn’t know where to put it
[2024/5/7 04:26:22] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/5/7 04:26:35] Eric Gao: I’ll leave it somewhere outside then
[2024/5/7 04:31:23] Sunaya: btw did you go look at your papers yesterday to see where you made mistakes?
[2024/5/7 04:31:33] Eric Gao: Gti? Yea
[2024/5/7 04:31:59] Eric Gao: Lost 3 marks accidentally, the rest were expected
[2024/5/7 04:32:59] Sunaya: oh I see I should’ve looked at mine too
[2024/5/7 04:33:50] Sunaya: also do you know that prof christos knows that someone had the papers but he can’t do nothing cause he doesn’t have evidence
[2024/5/7 04:34:09] Eric Gao: I know
[2024/5/7 04:34:47] Sunaya: I happy it’ll be better in algo
[2024/5/7 04:34:57] Sunaya: Cause he’ll prepare for that to happen
[2024/5/7 04:35:04] Eric Gao: True
[2024/5/7 04:35:13] Sunaya: yknow Haolin failed 210
[2024/5/7 04:35:16] Eric Gao: What!
[2024/5/7 04:35:20] Eric Gao: How
[2024/5/7 04:35:22] Sunaya: and might possibly gti too
[2024/5/7 04:35:25] Eric Gao: Damn
[2024/5/7 04:35:31] Sunaya: he had 50 smt overall percent
[2024/5/7 04:35:43] Sunaya: I think he has like 65 maybe or 60 smt
[2024/5/7 04:35:48] Eric Gao: Damn
[2024/5/7 04:35:49] Sunaya: so depending on the curve
[2024/5/7 04:36:07] Sunaya: also do you know all the ppl who were absent for gti and 210 weren’t sick at all
[2024/5/7 04:36:19] Sunaya: some of them even came to dohaquest
[2024/5/7 04:36:34] Eric Gao: I was one of the people that told this to him. The one thing I absolutely hated wasn’t a single cheater, but a bunch of cheaters who made everything shitty
[2024/5/7 04:36:34] Sunaya: and they’re doing their exam on August
[2024/5/7 04:36:56] Eric Gao: I know this too
[2024/5/7 04:37:34] Eric Gao: I usually don’t care what others do, but when they’re making things unjust and unfair I can’t sit and watch
[2024/5/7 04:37:47] Sunaya: oh I thought christos figured it out himself
[2024/5/7 04:38:16] Sunaya: true if you don’t have em you’re screwed cause everyone else will do extremely well
[2024/5/7 04:38:48] Eric Gao: I told him about mt2 a few weeks ago, and a few days before the final someone else told him, and he changed all the questions
[2024/5/7 04:39:23] Sunaya: Oh I see
[2024/5/7 04:39:23] Eric Gao: Yea. Uni is a place to learn, not a place to get grades no matter the cost
[2024/5/7 04:42:04] Sunaya: also what was the final worth?
[2024/5/7 04:42:09] Sunaya: 105?
[2024/5/7 04:42:21] Eric Gao: Yea, but out of 100, so 5 is bonus
[2024/5/7 04:42:36] Sunaya: oh
[2024/5/7 05:59:16] Sunaya: do you have Esomeprazole
[2024/5/7 05:59:32] Sunaya: or any sort of medicine like that for acid reflux?
[2024/5/7 05:59:53] Sunaya: I didn’t eat too much yesterday and in the morning and took the medicine in an empty stocmatch
[2024/5/7 06:00:09] Eric Gao: unfortunately I dont
[2024/5/7 06:00:15] Sunaya: oh okay
[2024/5/7 06:00:30] Eric Gao: I'm on campus rn, if you want I can go buy something from student center and bring to you
[2024/5/7 06:00:38] Sunaya: no it’s fine
[2024/5/7 06:00:43] Eric Gao: ok
[2024/5/7 06:00:48] Sunaya: I have anatacid I’ll just use that
[2024/5/7 10:00:59] Eric Gao: You want dinner together?

[2024/9/12 11:44:55] Sunaya: aslo i thought about it and its actually better to go in spring
[2024/9/12 11:45:19] Sunaya: cause youd want to focus on like applications and maybe senior thesis in your senior year

[2024/9/12 11:47:24] Sunaya: need to see what pittsburgh has to offer and do you know if its possible to do senior thesis remote i think it is depending on the prof

[2024/9/12 11:53:17] Eric Gao: I had no strong reasons to go in spring either
[2024/9/12 11:54:05] Sunaya: for me the only reason in going is the bois are going
[2024/9/12 11:54:44] Sunaya: are you planning to do senior thesis?
[2024/9/12 11:55:34] Eric Gao: I think finding research opportunities at Pittsburgh is probably better
[2024/9/12 11:55:55] Sunaya: hmmm so like no senior thesis but other research
[2024/9/12 11:56:29] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/9/12 11:56:34] Eric Gao: I feel like that's more effective
[2024/9/12 11:58:08] Sunaya: true
[2024/9/12 11:58:39] Sunaya: im only worried about not being accepted in fall
[2024/9/12 11:58:46] Sunaya: too conpetitive

[2024/9/12 16:55:02] Sunaya: its killing me
[2024/9/12 16:55:18] Sunaya: theres no reason for me not to go in spring other than not being with you guys
[2024/9/12 16:58:07] Eric Gao: You have lorenzo
[2024/9/12 16:58:19] Sunaya: also how are you awkwe
[2024/9/12 16:58:19] Eric Gao: Jonathan is also there

[2024/9/12 16:59:55] Eric Gao: Now you have a few more reasons
[2024/9/12 17:01:03] Sunaya: thats literally what i said cause not being with you guys
[2024/9/12 17:01:59] Eric Gao: Oh yea true
[2024/9/12 17:02:17] Sunaya: ill have a chart tomorrow and ahow you you let me know
[2024/9/12 17:02:25] Sunaya: ill also ask my parents see what they say
[2024/9/12 17:02:54] Eric Gao: Ok
[2024/9/12 17:03:26] Sunaya: cause eveyone ive talked to even the advisors said its best to go spring but my heart says otherwise and im not being rationale which something does work out
[2024/9/12 17:09:17] Sunaya: ALSO ARE YOU GOOD?
[2024/9/12 17:09:27] Sunaya: dont need to take you to hospital
[2024/9/12 17:09:51] Eric Gao: I’m good de
[2024/9/12 17:09:53] Eric Gao: Dw
[2024/9/12 17:10:02] Sunaya: okay good
[2024/9/12 17:10:38] Eric Gao: Why spring is better tho
[2024/9/12 17:14:59] Sunaya: first off, you have your whole senior year in qatar, can start working on applications, senior thesis, search for interrnational jobs, less stress cause its a known enviroment. You cna easily get in exchange program to pittsburgh too. 

For fall, youd be in pittsburgh prolly would want to have fun go travel nyc party around and with differnt courses and a new environmeny might not have enough time for applications and such stuff. competitive to get in and you may not get in at all which is a big gamble.
[2024/9/12 17:17:08] Sunaya: the thing is when i was in japan i used to travel or have fun almost everyday and i didnt have time for anything i have a deeling it might be similar there?
[2024/9/12 17:29:42] Sunaya: and one more thing why would you put it off for the last sem which you know everones going in when you can go earlier and theres not that big of a difference
[2024/9/12 23:01:24] Eric Gao: Makes sense
[2024/9/12 23:01:45] Eric Gao: I think you can always just choose to work kn stuff
[2024/9/12 23:02:16] Eric Gao: Yea true
[2024/9/13 00:23:31] Sunaya: how is it now the spice
[2024/9/13 01:32:47] Sunaya: breakfast cafe?
[2024/9/13 01:33:07] Eric Gao: Just woke up
[2024/9/13 01:33:34] Eric Gao: Woke up at 4:30, pooped, slept, pooped again at 6, slept

[2024/9/13 02:02:36] Sunaya: also just realized theres tarnival and stuff in the spring sem
[2024/9/13 02:02:54] Eric Gao: yea true
[2024/9/13 02:03:08] Eric Gao: I think that was the only reason I had to go in spring
[2024/9/13 02:06:25] Sunaya: yes but for you the acholarship too
[2024/9/13 02:06:37] Sunaya: youd have to pay yourself if you go senior
[2024/9/13 02:06:37] Eric Gao: meh
[2024/9/13 02:06:45] Sunaya: bruhhhh
[2024/9/13 02:06:51] Sunaya: thats 30k usd
[2024/9/13 02:06:53] Eric Gao: I already paid for the firs tyear
[2024/9/13 02:07:02] Eric Gao: that's almost 70k
[2024/9/13 02:07:19] Sunaya: yeah but you could save 30k by going spring
[2024/9/13 02:07:28] Eric Gao: worst case I'll just not go
[2024/9/13 02:09:12] Sunaya: bruhhhh
[2024/9/13 02:10:53] Sunaya: wait why fall again
[2024/9/13 02:11:42] Sunaya: like rationally
[2024/9/13 02:11:56] Eric Gao: no reason

[2024/9/22 01:12:36] Sunaya: is you S and T inversions and non inversions between the two list
[2024/9/22 01:12:59] Eric Gao: Same as lecture
[2024/9/22 01:13:10] Sunaya: from pos 0 to pos of c
[2024/9/22 01:13:12] Sunaya: x
[2024/9/22 01:14:00] Sunaya: but how can you say difference is t - s when it only goes up until half of pos(x)
[2024/9/22 01:14:35] Eric Gao: Hmm true, what should it be then
[2024/9/22 01:14:41] Eric Gao: I didn’t fully understand what s and t are
[2024/9/22 01:14:59] Sunaya: brooo
[2024/9/22 01:15:05] Sunaya: Bruhhhh
[2024/9/22 01:15:25] Sunaya: i dont know
[2024/9/22 01:15:32] Eric Gao: Should be 1/2 of that?
[2024/9/22 01:15:49] Sunaya: we dont know though cause we cant assume its exactly half
[2024/9/22 01:16:17] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/9/22 01:17:55] Eric Gao: How did you get 6
‎[2024/9/22 01:18:19] Sunaya:‎<附件：00009746-PHOTO-2024-09-22-01-18-19.jpg>
[2024/9/22 01:18:25] Sunaya: got this from hanna
[2024/9/22 01:18:49] Sunaya: i think they represented s and t from i/2 to i
[2024/9/22 01:19:09] Sunaya: however even then a lot whats here is assumption and wrong so i dont know myself
[2024/9/22 01:19:17] Sunaya: and ive asked other ppl and they dont know too
[2024/9/22 01:19:32] Sunaya: like bro if you go to Oh atleast make sure you understand
[2024/9/22 01:20:04] Eric Gao: Yea true
‎[2024/9/22 01:24:16] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00009753-PHOTO-2024-09-22-01-24-16.jpg>
[2024/9/22 01:24:55] Eric Gao: Do you know why in the class the costB(tj) is at least t+1?
[2024/9/22 01:25:11] Eric Gao: And why the potential difference is t-s
[2024/9/22 01:32:35] Sunaya: oh yes
[2024/9/22 01:34:25] Sunaya: its cause once you shift to the front all the non i versions become inversiona and inversions become non i versions
[2024/9/22 01:34:51] Sunaya: t is the set of all the y infront of x in both the list
[2024/9/22 01:35:05] Sunaya: so it has to atleast go through all the t before it can reach x
[2024/9/22 01:39:48] Sunaya: are you on your bed?
[2024/9/22 01:40:32] Eric Gao: oh yea makes sense
[2024/9/22 01:41:01] Eric Gao: I was
[2024/9/22 01:41:29] Sunaya: suprising never assumed youd work on your bed
[2024/9/22 01:41:45] Eric Gao: my head hurts a bit and I didn't want to sit up
[2024/9/22 01:41:53] Eric Gao: so I just grabbed my ipad and stared at the questino
[2024/9/22 01:42:20] Sunaya: i see
[2024/9/22 01:42:45] Eric Gao: if we set t to be the non inversions from 1/2i to i then this won't be t+1 right?
[2024/9/22 01:43:28] Eric Gao: but this can still be t-s
[2024/9/22 01:44:26] Sunaya: yes if its from i/2 to i
[2024/9/22 02:20:37] Sunaya: how was the banana
[2024/9/22 02:33:35] Eric Gao: It was actually good
[2024/9/22 02:33:38] Eric Gao: Not green not rotten
[2024/9/22 13:24:18] Sunaya: are you really not making diagrams

[2024/9/22 13:24:32] Sunaya: I've been looking at it and idk

[2024/10/4 03:24:03] Sunaya: how did you test if your delete fubction works
[2024/10/4 03:24:12] Sunaya: cause yhe test they gave do t
[2024/10/4 03:24:59] Eric Gao: did you type with your toes bro ‎<这条消息已经过编辑>
[2024/10/4 03:25:12] Eric Gao: I just trusted
[2024/10/4 03:25:47] Sunaya: ughhh
[2024/10/4 03:27:24] Sunaya: i fibished but idk if delete works properly or not
[2024/10/4 03:29:09] Eric Gao: you can probably write your own testcase if you want
[2024/10/4 03:29:31] Sunaya: yeah ill do it if i have time
[2024/10/4 03:29:38] Sunaya: cause i need to write comments too
[2024/10/4 03:29:49] Sunaya: and study
[2024/10/4 03:30:36] Eric Gao: yea
[2024/10/6 08:54:38] Sunaya: eric
[2024/10/6 10:14:48] Eric Gao: Ye
[2024/10/6 10:57:49] Eric Gao: dp and graph will not be on midterm right?
[2024/10/6 11:00:36] Sunaya: ye
[2024/10/6 11:01:03] Eric Gao: good
[2024/10/6 11:01:10] Sunaya: did you do the probability one
[2024/10/6 11:01:12] Sunaya: last
[2024/10/6 11:01:16] Sunaya: mock
[2024/10/6 11:02:24] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/10/6 11:04:13] Sunaya: how long did it take you to do it
[2024/10/6 11:07:03] Eric Gao: probably 10-20min
[2024/10/6 12:23:13] Sunaya: what did you get for that
[2024/10/6 12:23:44] Eric Gao: 1/i for a (i > 2)
[2024/10/6 12:24:15] Sunaya: how tho isn't that the probability that it's the greatest among i numbers?
[2024/10/6 12:24:23] Eric Gao: the same no?
[2024/10/6 12:24:31] Sunaya: no we want the second greatest
[2024/10/6 12:24:44] Eric Gao: there are i! permutations, and among them if we fix the second largest to be the ith element, then there are (i-1)! permutations
[2024/10/6 12:26:05] Eric Gao: for b, Hn
[2024/10/6 12:26:17] Eric Gao: for c, something like 2Hn+n-5
[2024/10/6 12:27:33] Sunaya: i think i understood the question completely differently
[2024/10/6 12:29:24] Eric Gao: what did you get
[2024/10/6 12:30:08] Sunaya: so we're saying among i elements, there's a silver, and the ith being the silver is we fix ith as the silver and see the permutations of others
[2024/10/6 12:30:22] Sunaya: but there could be multiple silvers at the ith place no?
[2024/10/6 12:31:44] Eric Gao: not really
[2024/10/6 12:31:58] Eric Gao: for the first i elements, there has to be one element among those i that is the second largest (silver)
[2024/10/6 12:32:54] Eric Gao: it doesn't really matter what exactly are those first i elements, since for whichever permutation of the whole list, if we fix one permutation, then the silver in first i will be fixed too
[2024/10/6 12:35:45] Sunaya: i think i get it
[2024/10/6 12:35:58] Sunaya: but it need to sink in more
[2024/10/6 12:36:45] Eric Gao: yea bro
[2024/10/6 12:36:47] Eric Gao: lock in
[2024/10/6 12:37:03] Sunaya: i don't even know how to study
[2024/10/6 12:37:19] Sunaya: there's a lot of stuff i want to look at but i don't hink i'll have time
[2024/10/6 12:39:12] Eric Gao: just write a worksheet
[2024/10/6 12:39:20] Eric Gao: then you'll be fine
[2024/10/6 12:39:22] Eric Gao: relax bro
[2024/10/6 12:39:32] Eric Gao: one quiz doesn't mean everything, you still got it
[2024/10/6 12:40:22] Sunaya: yeah as long i do well on this one it shouldn't mattter
[2024/10/6 12:40:32] Eric Gao: yes
[2024/10/6 12:43:55] Sunaya: also i'll try to do the quiz problems from memory and i'll check with you
[2024/10/6 12:44:09] Eric Gao: ok sure
[2024/10/6 13:44:45] Sunaya: idk how to do the merge sort
[2024/10/6 13:45:17] Sunaya: you need to consider two things
[2024/10/6 13:45:30] Sunaya: 1) the split 2) whether Left side is all small
[2024/10/6 13:45:39] Sunaya: if you have 1 2 3 4 | 8 9 20 34
[2024/10/6 13:45:47] Sunaya: since all the elments to the right are less than left there's only going to be 4 comparisions
[2024/10/6 13:45:54] Sunaya: 8 9 20 34 | 1 2 3 4 whereas if this happened there would be 8 comparisions
[2024/10/6 13:45:57] Eric Gao: What is this question?
[2024/10/6 13:46:00] Sunaya: so it's not just splitting you have to worry about
[2024/10/6 13:46:04] Eric Gao: From quiz?
[2024/10/6 13:46:05] Sunaya: randomized merge sort
[2024/10/6 13:46:11] Sunaya: randomly selecting the splitting point
[2024/10/6 13:47:06] Eric Gao: Not really, you’d only need to compare 8 with 1234, so still 4 comparisons
[2024/10/6 13:49:03] Sunaya: right
[2024/10/6 13:49:21] Sunaya: hmm ig you could upper bound it by n comparisions then
[2024/10/6 13:49:33] Sunaya: then it's the exact same as quick sort
[2024/10/6 13:49:52] Sunaya: ugh j realized if i wrote same for quick sort without thinking it'd be correct
[2024/10/6 13:56:42] Eric Gao: Also why randomly choosing split point
[2024/10/6 13:56:53] Eric Gao: Doesn’t mergesort always split at half?
[2024/10/6 13:56:54] Sunaya: the question says so
[2024/10/6 13:57:15] Eric Gao: Yea
[2024/10/6 13:57:15] Sunaya: yeah but qn is like that to test us
[2024/10/6 13:57:18] Eric Gao: Oh ok
[2024/10/7 00:53:01] Sunaya: how did you solve 6 c of the mock
[2024/10/7 00:53:11] Sunaya: how do we use the answer from before in our solution
[2024/10/7 01:36:03] Sunaya: did you get this
‎[2024/10/7 01:36:03] Sunaya:‎<附件：00010077-PHOTO-2024-10-07-01-36-03.jpg>
[2024/10/7 01:49:05] Eric Gao: no I got something different
[2024/10/7 01:49:20] Sunaya: is thi wrong how is this wrong
[2024/10/7 01:49:29] Eric Gao: I defined Yi to be the number of comparisons that the ith element is using
[2024/10/7 01:50:07] Eric Gao: there are 3 cases. if ith element is largest so far, then there's 2 cmps. Same for if ith element is the second largest. Otherwise, there's only 1 cmp
[2024/10/7 01:50:20] Eric Gao: the first two cases both have prob. 1/i, the third case have prob (1-2/i)
[2024/10/7 01:50:32] Eric Gao: so the expectation is 2/i+1 for i > 2
[2024/10/7 01:50:43] Eric Gao: (for Yi)
[2024/10/7 01:51:00] Sunaya: but you don't make use of the calculation you did eariliser no when you do this
[2024/10/7 01:51:24] Eric Gao: think the only extra thing is handling the case where ith elm is largest
[2024/10/7 01:51:28] Eric Gao: which wasn't calculated before
[2024/10/7 01:53:46] Sunaya: i don't know how this is not correct, cause if ai is not silver then it goes to the other comparision which is 1 - Sn no?
[2024/10/7 01:55:44] Eric Gao: I don't think so, since for gold you do the same number of comparisons as silver
[2024/10/7 01:55:46] Sunaya: if ai greater than silver then it's a silver, i.e we've found another silver and this is true Sn times. so ai > gold gets compared sn times
[2024/10/7 01:56:01] Eric Gao: yea so you have 2 Sn
[2024/10/7 01:56:15] Eric Gao: and you only have 1
[2024/10/7 01:56:27] Eric Gao: 1 Sn for silvers, and 1 Sn for golds
[2024/10/7 01:59:24] Sunaya: no it's j 1 Sn
[2024/10/7 01:59:35] Eric Gao: why
[2024/10/7 01:59:40] Sunaya: if ai > silver is only true when we have a new silver
[2024/10/7 01:59:50] Sunaya: and this being true causes one more comparison
[2024/10/7 01:59:58] Sunaya: and this is true Sn times
[2024/10/7 02:00:10] Eric Gao: yea so ai needs to be either silver OR GOLD for this to happen
[2024/10/7 02:00:26] Eric Gao: it's either the second largest or the largest
[2024/10/7 02:00:45] Eric Gao: if you only consider ai being silver then you're missing the golds
[2024/10/7 02:00:53] Sunaya: ahhh i see
[2024/10/7 02:01:29] Sunaya: so the final answer is n -1 + 2Sn ?
[2024/10/7 02:05:55] Sunaya: we need to add - c for the offset of 3 i think
[2024/10/7 02:12:07] Eric Gao: yea something like that
[2024/10/7 11:11:11] Sunaya: bro i forgot about my appointment
[2024/10/7 11:11:17] Sunaya: j realizrf
[2024/10/7 11:17:27] Eric Gao: Shitbro
[2024/10/7 11:17:54] Sunaya: its fine since i dont have anything improtant to worry about
[2024/10/7 11:18:06] Sunaya: for now
[2024/10/7 11:19:09] Eric Gao: Good
[2024/10/7 11:26:31] Eric Gao: What do you want for dinner?

[2024/10/21 11:32:56] Eric Gao: Thank you man
[2024/10/21 11:33:15] Sunaya: j remember sometimes you dont need to solve everything yourself and can rely on someone else
[2024/10/21 11:33:24] Sunaya: ill always have your back
[2024/10/21 11:33:32] Eric Gao: Bro don’t make me cry
[2024/10/21 11:33:46] Eric Gao: One of the big reasons that I was feeling bad is I got below average in algo midterm
[2024/10/21 11:34:20] Sunaya: its alright this sem is just not a good semester
[2024/10/21 11:34:46] Eric Gao: Yea everything is weird
[2024/10/21 11:34:55] Sunaya: yeah
[2024/10/21 11:35:42] Eric Gao: I had a emotion breakdown and I wasn’t feel like doing anything, and after algo I just thought that I need to fix it and I just went to mall
[2024/10/21 11:35:56] Eric Gao: I was almost going to ask you for prozac, then I thought ehh I’ll be fine
[2024/10/21 11:36:31] Sunaya: prozac is useless, doesnt even do anything
[2024/10/21 11:37:12] Eric Gao: Yea I never trust any mental health medicine other than alcohol
[2024/10/21 11:37:23] Eric Gao: Alcohol works for everyone
[2024/10/21 11:38:29] Sunaya: we couldve played cards!! itll numb aways the sadness at least for a while
[2024/10/21 11:39:42] Sunaya: but yeah i get how you feel, i dont know if you feel this way but it sorta feel like i have nothing under control this sem, like i cant do anything forsure
[2024/10/21 11:40:14] Sunaya: i dont know about that but ive heard heroine does it even better
[2024/10/21 11:40:33] Eric Gao: Yea true.. I would have played cards if there wasn’t also some relationship things I needed to deal with because I messed up something and it couldn’t wait
[2024/10/21 11:40:56] Eric Gao: Yea true, feels like everything is going in weird ways
[2024/10/21 11:41:03] Eric Gao: You got some bro?
[2024/10/21 11:41:11] Sunaya: I WISH
[2024/10/21 11:42:44] Eric Gao: I think my lifestyle is too healthy
[2024/10/21 11:42:56] Eric Gao: Before I used to like drinking so at least there’s something I can do
[2024/10/21 11:43:08] Eric Gao: Now there’s no bad habits left
[2024/10/21 11:43:51] Eric Gao: No women no drinking no gaming
[2024/10/21 11:45:20] Sunaya: don't stress about algo and courses in general, it's funny coming from me cause i always complain and i'll prolly keep complaining but in the end it doesn't really matter, it's j you feel empty and sad that you could've done so much better but didn't but that's part of learning so next exams do better and even if you don't SO WHAT
[2024/10/21 11:46:08] Eric Gao: Yea true thanks for telling me
[2024/10/21 11:46:45] Sunaya: i sorta blame it on Qatar too which might not be justifiable but ehh gotta point figers at something right?
[2024/10/21 11:46:55] Eric Gao: Yea now I see why
[2024/10/21 11:47:07] Eric Gao: I probably would feel better if I do the same

[2024/11/2 14:22:28] Eric Gao: I didn't like that Indian dude
[2024/11/2 14:22:33] Eric Gao: it's ok
[2024/11/2 14:30:31] Sunaya: ugh i am so extremely angry and sad and frustrated that i j want to leave Qatar right now.
[2024/11/2 14:30:50] Sunaya: it's been brewing up for some time and today was the last straw
[2024/11/2 15:04:32] Eric Gao: What are you angry and sad and frustrated about?

[2024/11/2 15:06:06] Eric Gao: What did he say?
[2024/11/2 15:06:21] Eric Gao: You mean about Z saying who to date?
[2024/11/2 15:07:24] Sunaya: there's more to it, but briefly about myself and how sad my life is. there's nothing fun, i stopped doing a lot of stuff, and i tried but can't be content with myself. i'm always try to find other ppls attention i feel like, and i felt like i dont' belong anywhere. like we had a big festival and i was prolly the only nepali guy not invited on that too
[2024/11/2 15:08:47] Eric Gao: Bro you’re just too smart for this place.. yesterday two first year students were saying how smart you are in concepts SI sessions and how you trick them and help them learn
[2024/11/2 15:09:09] Eric Gao: You’re great for who you are and you gotta know that
[2024/11/2 15:09:34] Eric Gao: And you’re always welcomed to celebrate all the Chinese festivals
[2024/11/2 15:09:50] Sunaya: like even you guys i feel like i butted myself in your group and i don't belong with you guys. and they don't invite me in any nepali event too, or like anywhere
[2024/11/2 15:10:25] Sunaya: idk i need to be content with myself and stop relying on my happiness being depend on other ppl but i j can't seem to do that
[2024/11/2 15:11:09] Eric Gao: No we’re happy to have you but it’s just we are guys and we are not human enough to say it out loud. I would feel weird if I just hang out alone with lorenzo or haolin
[2024/11/2 15:11:58] Eric Gao: Just do whatever you feel like doing. Wear a thobe tmr because it’s random and fun
[2024/11/2 15:12:32] Eric Gao: Maybe randomly go to a library one night and buy a book there
[2024/11/2 15:12:54] Eric Gao: Or show up in a movie theater one day and find the most arab film to watch

[2024/11/8 05:08:42] Eric Gao: ok

[2024/11/8 12:51:12] Eric Gao: The best thing to do is to not let it consume you more. You already did too many things without return and think about how to not lose more
[2024/11/8 12:52:05] Eric Gao: When you’re feeling mad, it’s you caring about the whole thing, and that’s something which again you’ll not get anything back for

[2024/12/2 04:24:54] Eric Gao: parallelize this with ray. Note the following:
With MPI for Kmeans, you sent each machine or process the subset of
points that it should cluster once in the beginning.
• You should be able to do the same with Ray by creating actors and each actor (when
created) is assigned a subset of points to cluster in parallel.
• At each iteration, like in MPI, you should be calling the cluster task (function) on each
actor passing only the new centroids.
• You should not be only relying on stateless tasks and passing the subsets of
points that each machine/process should cluster over and over in every
iteration.
• This creates unnecessary overhead and will lead to bad performance in Ray
[2024/12/2 04:32:23] Sunaya: what are you having for food
[2024/12/2 04:37:36] Eric Gao: Free food in admissions office

[2024/12/13 17:45:15] Sunaya: too many accidents
[2024/12/13 17:45:17] Eric Gao: Lol
[2024/12/13 17:45:23] Eric Gao: Probably 1/3 the price tho

[2024/12/13 17:45:47] Sunaya: same price
[2024/12/13 17:45:47] Eric Gao: Damn with this accident rate?
[2024/12/13 17:46:22] Sunaya: more accidents more ppl don't wanna take it and they prolly can't even cover their costs so can't charge low
[2024/12/13 17:46:31] Eric Gao: Damn
[2024/12/13 17:47:00] Sunaya: but the accidents are usually domestics flights tho

‎[2024/12/13 17:49:54] Sunaya:‎<附件：00012318-PHOTO-2024-12-13-17-49-54.jpg>

[2025/1/27 12:52:53] Sunaya: busy
[2025/1/27 12:52:57] Sunaya: and how are you finding qatar
[2025/1/27 12:56:18] Eric Gao: sem is ok overall I think, I like networks, DL seems fun but I need to rewatch all the lectures, global history is really chill, math and arts is a little boring but I don't really need to do much, independent study with Khaled is as challenging as always, lifelines is taking way too much of my time, CA for 110 and 210 are pretty chill
[2025/1/27 12:56:37] Sunaya: i see
[2025/1/27 12:56:40] Sunaya: what about doha itself
[2025/1/27 12:57:11] Sunaya: kinda same a lot of work this sem, but i'm enjoying all the courses i'm taking so far so that's good
[2025/1/27 12:57:30] Sunaya: not a single that i'd think i'd drop
[2025/1/27 12:57:46] Eric Gao: eh I mainly don't like paying double the amount and get half of what I'd get in China, but I like that service workers here are more respectful
[2025/1/27 12:57:59] Sunaya: i see
[2025/1/27 12:58:38] Sunaya: interesting, everthign seems to be good, that's nice
[2025/1/27 12:58:46] Eric Gao: ok that's great
[2025/1/27 12:59:20] Eric Gao: yea, just a little busy, I will drop lifelines as soon as I can
[2025/1/27 13:00:15] Sunaya: yeah it'll make the sem a lot lighter
[2025/1/27 13:00:38] Eric Gao: yea true
[2025/1/27 13:00:43] Eric Gao: how's your semester
[2025/1/27 13:00:51] Eric Gao: is it fun so far?
[2025/1/27 13:01:14] Sunaya: i would say so although i'd love to be ahead of a lot of my work so i can chill sometimes but that's fine
[2025/1/27 13:01:47] Sunaya: surprisingly without Lorenzo i havnen't really done anything outside dorms and courses
[2025/1/27 13:01:55] Eric Gao: yea I'd want that too
[2025/1/27 13:02:13] Sunaya: i go to haolin he busy or smt, and everone else occupied with their own stuff too
[2025/1/27 13:02:20] Eric Gao: interesting
[2025/1/27 13:02:41] Sunaya: and no one really gets the ppl together to go somewhere
[2025/1/27 13:02:57] Sunaya: or maybe it's you're busy Lorenzo absent and so it's j me and haolin
[2025/1/27 13:03:04] Sunaya: and we don't do anything really
[2025/1/27 13:03:04] Eric Gao: huh interesting

[2025/2/3 12:42:54] Eric Gao: also I realized that I forgot to pass in val_loss to the scheduler step function, and it's basically useless
[2025/2/3 12:43:08] Eric Gao: but I don't want to stop the run and restart
[2025/2/3 12:49:32] Sunaya: j stop it its not gonna get better
[2025/2/3 12:49:44] Sunaya: and even if it does its not gonna be 86
[2025/2/3 12:49:53] Sunaya: so might as well try something different
[2025/2/3 12:50:29] Eric Gao: it went up by 0.2%, now it's 83.24
[2025/2/3 12:50:32] Sunaya: btw do you have sandpaper?
[2025/2/3 12:50:50] Eric Gao: I don't
[2025/2/3 12:51:14] Sunaya: training and val both are stagnating
[2025/2/3 12:51:18] Sunaya: maybe add more layets
[2025/2/3 12:51:20] Sunaya: layers
[2025/2/3 12:51:34] Sunaya: cause hanna said she got 83 by adding more layers
[2025/2/3 12:52:40] Eric Gao: ok I'll try to through in a few more 1024 layers
[2025/2/3 12:53:07] Sunaya: also yknow i finished all my kaggle AND google colab hours
[2025/2/3 12:53:16] Sunaya: now i need to buy
[2025/2/3 12:53:20] Eric Gao: gyat daym
[2025/2/3 12:53:34] Sunaya: and it didnt even run properly
[2025/2/3 12:53:47] Sunaya: got stuck midway and next architecture the same result
[2025/2/3 12:56:07] Eric Gao: dmn
[2025/2/3 12:56:29] Sunaya: i wonder whats actually happening that causing the plataeu
[2025/2/3 13:00:03] Eric Gao: no idea

[2025/2/3 13:14:50] Eric Gao: brobrobro
[2025/2/3 13:15:16] Eric Gao: my learning rate actually stepped
[2025/2/3 13:15:31] Eric Gao: and my training accuracy is over 87 now
[2025/2/3 13:15:50] Eric Gao: I think it was right that the loss wiggled around the little hole

[2025/2/3 14:56:25] Sunaya: oh shit oh shit
[2025/2/3 14:56:30] Sunaya: damn so that was the case
[2025/2/3 14:56:57] Sunaya: omg i feel like i understand a lot now
[2025/2/3 14:59:09] Eric Gao: 😂
[2025/2/3 14:59:35] Sunaya: did you try all the other arch that was stagnating but with learning rate reduced like how we do here
[2025/2/3 14:59:49] Eric Gao: i didn't try those
[2025/2/3 15:00:03] Sunaya: cause i feel like all of those would also give 86 but learning rate was the only problem
[2025/2/3 15:00:09] Sunaya: damn okay ill try and see
[2025/2/3 15:08:14] Sunaya: i still cant believe
[2025/2/3 15:08:21] Sunaya: damn man damnn
[2025/2/3 15:08:44] Sunaya: i’m so glad we had yo do so mamy runs to figure this out
[2025/2/3 15:08:52] Eric Gao: yea bro
[2025/2/3 15:09:01] Sunaya: and eman saying use the thigy helped too lol
[2025/2/3 15:09:19] Eric Gao: which thingy
[2025/2/3 15:09:22] Sunaya: when i thought all CAs where useless although she should have said maybe youre wiggling around
[2025/2/3 15:09:38] Sunaya: the reduce thingy
[2025/2/3 15:09:43] Eric Gao: ohok
[2025/2/3 15:09:49] Eric Gao: no I said we're wiggling around
[2025/2/3 15:10:03] Eric Gao: she said the learning rate is flucuating
[2025/2/3 15:10:39] Sunaya: yeah i meant she shoulve told this
[2025/2/3 15:11:10] Eric Gao: oh yea true
[2025/2/3 15:11:25] Sunaya: but like she was j telling to use reduce optimizer amd we were like that gives even low accuracy
[2025/2/3 15:11:49] Sunaya: and like use cylinder wothout a valid reason for doing so
[2025/2/3 15:12:02] Sunaya: but GOD DAMN YOU SMART AS HELL
[2025/2/3 15:12:14] Sunaya: how did you think it was wigglying around
[2025/2/3 15:12:37] Eric Gao: idk bro lol i just guessed
[2025/2/3 15:12:52] Eric Gao: she kinda said the bottleneck thingy
[2025/2/3 15:12:57] Sunaya: good good i feel like im leaning
[2025/2/3 15:13:00] Sunaya: oh yeah true
[2025/2/3 15:13:16] Eric Gao: it's like a small hole and big dick
[2025/2/3 15:13:20] Sunaya: learning all that test didnt go to waste
[2025/2/3 15:13:33] Eric Gao: big dicks will keep rubbing around the rim
[2025/2/3 15:13:52] Eric Gao: small dicks will slide right in
[2025/2/3 15:14:10] Sunaya: yeah but if the small one is too long it might puncture somewhere
[2025/2/3 15:14:23] Eric Gao: I'll write these sentences if I ever publish a book about dl
[2025/2/3 15:14:24] Sunaya: like what happened with afitya with too many layets
[2025/2/3 15:14:39] Sunaya: punctured and went to a different dimesion
[2025/2/3 15:14:40] Eric Gao: true, needs to be the right size
[2025/2/3 15:14:51] Sunaya: yeah for the right person
[2025/2/3 15:15:06] Sunaya: so next time it might require a big fat one
[2025/2/3 15:15:21] Sunaya: big fat long one
[2025/2/3 15:15:40] Eric Gao: hmm the hole needs to be wider and deeper then
[2025/2/3 15:16:26] Sunaya: also was there a reason for context size to be 35?
[2025/2/3 15:17:10] Eric Gao: I just changed it smaller
[2025/2/3 15:17:28] Eric Gao: if it's too large then it might have more useless features which will confuse the model
[2025/2/3 15:17:34] Sunaya: true
[2025/2/3 15:17:45] Eric Gao: since we have 20M parameters, and we keep getting lower accuracy, I thought it's because model is confused
‎[2025/2/3 15:17:56] Sunaya:‎<附件：00012791-PHOTO-2025-02-03-15-17-56.jpg>
[2025/2/3 15:18:02] Sunaya: i was trying to watch this anime yesterday
[2025/2/3 15:18:10] Sunaya: and it was still open on one of the tabs
[2025/2/3 15:18:23] Eric Gao: lol how's that coindence
[2025/2/3 15:18:33] Sunaya: 86 accuracy
[2025/2/3 15:18:37] Eric Gao: ohh right
[2025/2/3 15:18:38] Sunaya: that we have been targeting
[2025/2/3 15:18:49] Sunaya: i never realized
[2025/2/3 15:19:14] Sunaya: alright imma work until at least 2 and sleep now lots of work
[2025/2/3 15:19:22] Sunaya: did you work on the independent study
[2025/2/3 15:20:22] Eric Gao: okok
[2025/2/3 15:20:28] Eric Gao: I'm working right now
[2025/2/3 15:20:33] Eric Gao: I drank a double shot espresso
[2025/2/3 15:20:38] Eric Gao: I'm extremely awake
[2025/2/3 15:20:42] Sunaya: i see i see alright good luck
[2025/2/3 15:20:47] Sunaya: imma start working too now
[2025/2/3 15:20:53] Eric Gao: ok good luck
[2025/2/3 15:23:53] Sunaya: remind me i have something to tell you tomorrow in person
[2025/2/3 15:24:13] Eric Gao: ok
[2025/2/3 15:24:16] Eric Gao: what is it about
[2025/2/3 15:24:20] Sunaya: HCI
[2025/2/3 15:24:22] Sunaya: and some IS ppl
[2025/2/3 15:24:27] Eric Gao: oh ok interesting
[2025/2/4 01:18:29] Sunaya: bruh i'm out of Kaggle aand collab you need US addressed card
[2025/2/4 01:22:12] Sunaya: how did you buy it again?
[2025/2/4 01:28:40] Eric Gao: I have a US bank card
[2025/2/4 01:28:48] Eric Gao: I got it when I went to pittsburgh
[2025/2/4 01:29:06] Sunaya: i see
[2025/2/4 01:30:51] Sunaya: i might need you to buy one for me i'll send the money in your qnb
[2025/2/4 01:30:59] Sunaya: cause there isn't a way for me to run it anymore
[2025/2/4 01:31:16] Sunaya: do you have enough in your US bank account?
[2025/2/4 02:42:21] Eric Gao: let me check if I can transfer to my US card
[2025/2/4 02:42:33] Sunaya: tranfer what?
[2025/2/4 02:42:42] Eric Gao: from qnb
[2025/2/4 02:42:46] Sunaya: i think i can wire transfer from the app
[2025/2/4 02:42:55] Sunaya: as long as you have an IBAN
[2025/2/4 02:42:59] Eric Gao: okok let me try
[2025/2/4 02:43:04] Sunaya: okay
[2025/2/4 02:47:32] Eric Gao: okk let me help
[2025/2/4 02:47:59] Sunaya: so it worked?
[2025/2/4 02:47:59] Eric Gao: I think I can wire transfer
[2025/2/4 02:48:06] Eric Gao: yea I just need to activate it later
[2025/2/4 02:48:23] Sunaya: ok ill ask you when i see you in person
[2025/2/4 02:48:27] Eric Gao: ok
[2025/2/4 02:48:35] Eric Gao: something you wanted to tell me about hci class
[2025/2/4 02:48:45] Sunaya: yeah in person
[2025/2/4 02:48:49] Eric Gao: okok
[2025/2/4 02:48:54] Sunaya: cause i dont wanna type it
[2025/2/4 02:48:59] Eric Gao: ok
[2025/2/4 03:41:36] Sunaya: also after the 20th epoch when the lr changed did it change again
[2025/2/4 03:42:09] Eric Gao: it did
[2025/2/4 03:42:26] Eric Gao: oh also remember to set the patience for the scheduler to be something small
[2025/2/4 03:42:37] Sunaya: what does patience do?
[2025/2/4 03:43:01] Sunaya: i was using StepLR instead of Reduce stepping as soon as it starts to stagnate
[2025/2/4 03:43:16] Sunaya: and did it stagnate at 85%?
[2025/2/4 03:43:41] Eric Gao: how many iterations do you wait for the accuracy to not improve before you reduce your learning rate
[2025/2/4 03:43:59] Sunaya: oh i see
[2025/2/4 03:44:21] Sunaya: for me i was reducing the learning rate every 5 epochs might need to make it every 10 epochs
[2025/2/4 03:44:30] Eric Gao: yea for 2/3 iterations
[2025/2/4 03:45:28] Sunaya: do you have the epoch information stored somewhere i wanna see how it was progressing
[2025/2/4 03:48:28] Eric Gao: lemme check wandb
‎[2025/2/4 03:49:38] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00012852-PHOTO-2025-02-04-03-49-38.jpg>
[2025/2/4 04:02:52] Sunaya: also you're using adam optimizer right
[2025/2/4 04:07:55] Eric Gao: yes
[2025/2/4 08:40:25] Sunaya: are you on campus?
[2025/2/4 08:45:03] Sunaya: also did you run the full 50 epochs?
[2025/2/4 08:45:21] Sunaya: and can you send me your configuration for scheduler?
[2025/2/4 09:51:27] Eric Gao: didn't; just 30
[2025/2/4 09:51:40] Sunaya: you stopped after that?
[2025/2/4 09:51:51] Sunaya: can you j stop and it'll save the model?
[2025/2/4 09:54:48] Eric Gao: yea I stopped
[2025/2/4 09:54:56] Eric Gao: it saved because I have a line that saves to wandb

[2025/2/15 08:28:55] Sunaya: 1066 looks okay but i don't even know which one it is
[2025/2/15 09:08:09] Eric Gao: maybe the study room in library?

[2025/2/17 23:01:21] Eric Gao: Lol
[2025/2/18 08:25:37] Sunaya: when?
[2025/2/18 08:39:08] Eric Gao: spring break
[2025/2/18 08:39:14] Eric Gao: too many work due
[2025/2/18 09:05:51] Sunaya: same
[2025/2/18 09:13:00] Sunaya: im j so fking mad and angry
[2025/2/18 09:29:18] Eric Gao: what happened bro
[2025/2/18 09:29:23] Eric Gao: your HCI team?
[2025/2/18 09:29:37] Sunaya: no something else
[2025/2/18 09:29:42] Eric Gao: what is it
[2025/2/18 11:12:43] Sunaya: j a bunch of stuff
[2025/2/18 11:16:25] Sunaya: bunch of small suff combined
[2025/2/18 11:23:56] Sunaya: quizzes, tt, bunch of interactions, some work, and other stuff all going haywire
[2025/2/18 12:19:19] Eric Gao: Huh
[2025/2/18 12:19:36] Eric Gao: I thought you’d be happier without z this sem
[2025/2/18 12:19:46] Sunaya: no i am it's just these few weeks
[2025/2/18 12:19:50] Eric Gao: Oh yea how’s that our sleep btw
[2025/2/18 12:19:54] Eric Gao: *your
[2025/2/18 12:19:59] Eric Gao: How’s your sleep
[2025/2/18 12:20:09] Eric Gao: Do you still pop pillsv
[2025/2/18 12:20:14] Sunaya: no
[2025/2/18 12:20:38] Eric Gao: Ok that’s good
[2025/2/18 12:23:56] Sunaya: i think only these couple of weeks that it's been bad but it's sorta my doing too
[2025/2/18 12:30:34] Sunaya: also i don't like when ppl say poping pills
[2025/2/18 12:39:33] Eric Gao: I’m sorry about it, won’t say that again
[2025/2/18 12:39:45] Sunaya: no its fine
[2025/2/18 12:39:58] Sunaya: but its been since womter break that i stopped
[2025/2/18 12:40:09] Sunaya: and i am more happy lol
[2025/2/18 12:40:14] Eric Gao: That’s good
[2025/2/18 12:40:22] Sunaya: except for this two week
[2025/2/18 12:40:35] Eric Gao: It’s gonna be spring break in 2 days
[2025/2/18 12:40:38] Sunaya: the pill is kinda useless only hlep with sleep
[2025/2/18 12:40:52] Sunaya: yeah
[2025/2/19 02:00:02] Sunaya: bro i missed class today
[2025/2/19 02:00:12] Sunaya: had my alram at 9:30 and didnt realiA
[2025/2/19 02:01:15] Eric Gao: What the heck
[2025/2/19 02:01:48] Sunaya: and its a class that if you miss 6 times you fail the course
[2025/2/19 12:31:09] Sunaya: bruhh how did you do p1 in 4 hours, the shitty array multiplying and dimesions is killing me
[2025/2/19 12:31:40] Sunaya: i feel like i need to do a course on multi dim array and learn to use
[2025/2/19 12:31:50] Sunaya: and i was using loops j realized we need to use tensor dot

[2025/2/19 12:49:58] Eric Gao: Yea too muc
[2025/2/19 12:49:59] Sunaya: bruhhh
[2025/2/19 12:50:02] Eric Gao: It’s there
[2025/2/19 12:50:06] Eric Gao: Meh it’s ok
[2025/2/19 12:50:45] Sunaya: how long do you think it'll take without gpt
[2025/2/19 12:50:54] Sunaya: cause i'm planning to do it without using it at all
[2025/2/19 12:51:04] Eric Gao: You probably should
[2025/2/19 12:51:24] Sunaya: and i'm getting too stuck i'm searching courses online to properly understand numpy and slicing and broadscasting
[2025/2/19 13:03:17] Eric Gao: you can ask chatgpt to explain it
‎[2025/2/21 13:15:11] Sunaya:‎<附件：00013031-PHOTO-2025-02-21-13-15-11.jpg>

‎[2025/2/21 14:47:29] Sunaya:‎<附件：00013033-PHOTO-2025-02-21-14-47-29.jpg>
[2025/2/21 14:47:58] Eric Gao: Lol
[2025/2/21 14:48:09] Eric Gao: Yea looks pretty similar
[2025/2/21 14:48:26] Eric Gao: The one I got was from tibet, I don’t think you can find it online
[2025/2/21 14:48:35] Eric Gao: It’s dried buffalo
[2025/2/21 14:48:39] Sunaya: i see
[2025/2/21 14:49:25] Sunaya: the 210 grading took me so much time
[2025/2/21 14:49:32] Eric Gao: Yea me too
[2025/2/21 14:49:38] Eric Gao: Took me probably 2 hours
[2025/2/21 14:50:07] Sunaya: have you watched spy x family
[2025/2/21 14:50:12] Eric Gao: I did
[2025/2/21 14:50:15] Sunaya: j started it yesterday really good
[2025/2/21 14:50:27] Eric Gao: Yea it is
[2025/2/21 14:50:32] Eric Gao: You haven’t watched it?
[2025/2/21 14:50:36] Sunaya: nope
[2025/2/21 14:50:50] Eric Gao: They have a movie too I think

[2025/2/23 01:38:43] Sunaya: i renewed it but don't know where to see it so i can send them this
[2025/2/23 01:39:06] Eric Gao: I don't know where to see
[2025/2/23 01:39:09] Eric Gao: I screenshotted it
[2025/2/23 01:39:20] Sunaya: oh shit i see
[2025/2/23 16:42:48] Sunaya: how are you spending the break

[2025/2/24 13:34:16] Eric Gao: Probably will have good burgers
[2025/2/24 13:34:20] Eric Gao: That’s their name afterall
[2025/2/24 13:34:34] Sunaya: ill try them next time
[2025/2/26 00:45:54] Sunaya: they havent released the pitts thingy yet right?
[2025/2/26 00:46:30] Eric Gao: I didn't get any emails
[2025/2/26 00:46:37] Sunaya: i see
[2025/2/26 00:47:37] Sunaya: hopefully we both get in
[2025/2/26 00:47:47] Eric Gao: yea hopefully
[2025/2/26 00:47:55] Eric Gao: inshallah as they say
[2025/2/26 00:48:45] Sunaya: i hate insshallah
[2025/2/26 00:48:52] Sunaya: they always ise it for everything
[2025/2/26 00:48:55] Sunaya: esp haolin
[2025/2/26 00:49:11] Sunaya: i ask him you want to order food? and hea like inshallah
[2025/2/26 00:49:24] Sunaya: wanna go tt now hes like inshallah
[2025/2/26 00:49:44] Eric Gao: I know lol
[2025/2/26 00:49:49] Sunaya: j say yes or no he alwAys insallah
[2025/2/26 00:50:06] Eric Gao: just think of that as an indirect no
[2025/2/26 00:50:19] Eric Gao: it he wants he'd say yes
[2025/2/26 09:29:23] Sunaya: i am so done being in the dorms all day everyday
[2025/2/26 09:29:33] Sunaya: what you up to?
[2025/2/26 09:32:43] Eric Gao: going to dinner with maria
[2025/2/26 09:33:02] Sunaya: i see have fun!
[2025/2/26 09:33:04] Eric Gao: I've been doing dl part 2 today
[2025/2/26 09:33:12] Eric Gao: thank you thank you
[2025/2/26 09:33:36] Eric Gao: I got 3.3 EER on Kaggle and idk if I should do more
[2025/2/26 09:34:07] Sunaya: i see i had 3.8 i think i'm trying to improve but it's not getting good it gets stuck after a point
[2025/2/26 09:34:16] Eric Gao: if you submit it should be better
[2025/2/26 09:34:26] Eric Gao: when I'm training mine was 3.6 or something
[2025/2/26 09:34:28] Sunaya: yah i'm hoping 2.8 at least
[2025/2/26 09:34:51] Sunaya: i submitted and it was higher haha
[2025/2/26 09:35:10] Sunaya: actually i had 3.66? or 3.33? but when uploaded it was slightly higher
[2025/2/26 09:35:16] Eric Gao: huh
[2025/2/26 09:35:30] Sunaya: could be cause the model that it saves is not the one with lowest EER instead the highest classification and verification one
[2025/2/26 09:35:40] Sunaya: and highest verification doesn't necessarily have lowest EER
[2025/2/26 09:37:39] Eric Gao: makes sense
[2025/2/26 09:37:55] Eric Gao: are you copying resnet34?
[2025/2/26 09:39:18] Sunaya: i did that but i think i forgot i was using only subset of the data so i didn't get lower so i used resnet50 with 2 as expansion but even that i though i was using the full dataset but unfortunately i wasn't and i ran the full 100 epochs too now i'm doing it again
[2025/2/26 09:39:32] Sunaya: but i added even more layers, so it's resnet50 with even more layers
[2025/2/26 09:39:46] Sunaya: so i have 29.5M para but it's not that good at least for now
[2025/2/26 09:39:51] Eric Gao: damn
[2025/2/26 09:40:07] Eric Gao: my resnet34 has 25.5M param already
[2025/2/26 09:40:17] Eric Gao: 25.7
[2025/2/26 09:40:29] Sunaya: lowest EER I've had rn is 3.33 at epoch 25
[2025/2/26 09:40:44] Sunaya: resnet50 with expansion 2 is 25M too
[2025/2/26 09:41:10] Sunaya: but there's a lot of overfitting for CLS but ig that doesn' tmatter cause we're being tested on verification task
[2025/2/26 09:41:19] Eric Gao: yea mine lowest was 3.66 at epoch 29
‎[2025/2/26 09:41:29] Sunaya:‎<附件：00013112-PHOTO-2025-02-26-09-41-29.jpg>
[2025/2/26 09:41:36] Sunaya: a lot of overfitting for cls
[2025/2/26 09:41:45] Eric Gao: I didn't have much overfitting
[2025/2/26 09:41:51] Sunaya: huh really?
[2025/2/26 09:42:00] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/2/26 09:42:09] Sunaya: enoch said the same thing but for me almost every model was overfitting
‎[2025/2/26 09:42:12] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00013118-PHOTO-2025-02-26-09-42-12.jpg>
[2025/2/26 09:42:19] Eric Gao: did you turn on augment?
[2025/2/26 09:43:12] Sunaya: yup a lot of transformations too
[2025/2/26 09:43:24] Sunaya: and smooth labeling and weight decay too

[2025/2/26 09:45:38] Eric Gao: Interesting
[2025/2/26 09:46:04] Sunaya: i never had your up down up down
[2025/2/26 09:46:41] Sunaya: and even when i use resnet like everyone else still a lot of overfitting even when it's the exact arch
[2025/2/26 09:47:15] Sunaya: what's the longest you've run
[2025/2/26 09:47:24] Sunaya: also what's your lowest EER you've gotten
[2025/2/26 09:47:55] Sunaya: also do you know how to ice skate?
[2025/2/26 09:47:59] Eric Gao: Are you cosineanmealing?
[2025/2/26 09:48:14] Eric Gao: I stopped at 40
[2025/2/26 09:48:17] Sunaya: nope
[2025/2/26 09:48:19] Eric Gao: That 3.66
[2025/2/26 09:48:24] Sunaya: reduceLR on plateau
[2025/2/26 09:48:27] Eric Gao: I think so
[2025/2/26 09:48:54] Sunaya: i used it initially i think but i thought reduce would be better
[2025/2/26 09:49:43] Eric Gao: Yea
[2025/2/26 09:49:45] Sunaya: i see
[2025/2/28 11:25:04] Sunaya: what's you doing?
[2025/3/1 01:50:05] Eric Gao: Just woke up
[2025/3/1 01:50:08] Eric Gao: Slept a little early
[2025/3/1 01:50:16] Eric Gao: Was reviewing networks
[2025/3/1 01:51:02] Eric Gao: Oh how’s your eer now
[2025/3/1 02:05:59] Sunaya: 2.44
[2025/3/1 02:06:25] Sunaya: resnet50 with expansion 2 and SGD
[2025/3/1 02:09:35] Sunaya: and learning rate 0.1 cause of SGD
[2025/3/1 02:09:48] Sunaya: optimizer reduceLR
[2025/3/1 02:11:56] Sunaya: locally and it was the same if not higher on kaggle
[2025/3/1 02:19:11] Sunaya: its really suprising ppl all get different results even with the same network
[2025/3/1 02:19:46] Sunaya: i think for hanna resnet34 worked and everything was same as original only change was using resnet
[2025/3/1 02:20:40] Sunaya: and about how for some people val and train acc is similar and for me its overfitting even with the same network
[2025/3/1 02:22:01] Sunaya: i see i was hoping we could do something together, but its fine. we have eid break too, hopefully its actually a break for you then
[2025/3/1 03:02:28] Eric Gao: Oh nice
[2025/3/1 03:03:27] Eric Gao: I’ll try later today
[2025/3/1 03:03:41] Eric Gao: Interesting
[2025/3/1 03:03:48] Eric Gao: Okok
[2025/3/1 12:36:17] Sunaya: what you doing?
[2025/3/1 12:38:37] Eric Gao: waiting for model to start overfitting
[2025/3/1 12:38:58] Sunaya: whats your eer at
[2025/3/1 12:39:01] Sunaya: which epoch
[2025/3/1 12:39:01] Eric Gao: it's been 57 epochs and both train and val loss are still decreasing
[2025/3/1 12:39:08] Sunaya: i see
[2025/3/1 12:39:12] Eric Gao: lowest is 3.46 I think
[2025/3/1 12:39:26] Sunaya: whats cls acc
[2025/3/1 12:39:49] Sunaya: for both train amd val
[2025/3/1 12:39:54] Eric Gao: validation is 90.4, train is 99.996
[2025/3/1 12:40:08] Sunaya: what about for ver
[2025/3/1 12:40:14] Sunaya: ACC
[2025/3/1 12:40:29] Eric Gao: bouncing between 96.5 to 86.7
[2025/3/1 12:40:33] Eric Gao: *96.7
[2025/3/1 12:40:37] Sunaya: bouncing?!
[2025/3/1 12:40:47] Sunaya: its not stable
[2025/3/1 12:40:56] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/3/1 12:41:02] Sunaya: what optimizer?
[2025/3/1 12:41:03] Eric Gao: probably not going inside the hole
[2025/3/1 12:41:08] Eric Gao: using adamw
[2025/3/1 12:41:16] Sunaya: and scheduled
[2025/3/1 12:41:23] Eric Gao: reducelr
[2025/3/1 12:41:32] Sunaya: huh interesting
[2025/3/1 12:41:51] Sunaya: in all my runs i never had it bouncing no matter the arch or the parameters
[2025/3/1 12:41:53] Eric Gao: my learning rate reduces too slowly
[2025/3/1 12:42:06] Eric Gao: it's just 0.2%, ig it's more or less smooth
[2025/3/1 12:42:16] Sunaya: its fine mine reduces at 30, 60 and then 70/80
[2025/3/1 12:42:32] Sunaya: oh you didnt mean 86.7
[2025/3/1 12:42:51] Sunaya: and this is resnet50 right
[2025/3/1 12:42:53] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/3/1 12:43:09] Eric Gao: I started with 0.01, it reduced at around 40
[2025/3/1 12:43:15] Eric Gao: I'll probably wait until 80
[2025/3/1 12:43:19] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/3/1 12:43:46] Sunaya: did you ever try SGD?
[2025/3/1 12:43:55] Sunaya: with momentum and weight decay
[2025/3/1 12:44:01] Eric Gao: not yet
[2025/3/1 12:45:38] Sunaya: if none of these work you can try to extend the resnet50 by adding some more blocks until it reaches 29M but this shouldn’t be necessary
[2025/3/1 12:45:49] Eric Gao: okok
[2025/3/1 12:45:54] Eric Gao: it's due tmr morning I think
[2025/3/1 12:46:04] Eric Gao: 11 more hours
[2025/3/1 12:46:12] Eric Gao: I'll just submit whatever I have from this run
[2025/3/1 12:46:42] Sunaya: hmmm i see
[2025/3/1 12:47:26] Sunaya: i never understood the way it works here cause enoch said he basically put the papaer in gpt and made it spit out the code and he got 2.4 eer with that
[2025/3/1 12:47:38] Sunaya: for resnet50
[2025/3/1 12:47:49] Eric Gao: I have no idea
[2025/3/1 12:48:23] Eric Gao: I was planning to rewatch all the dl lectures during spring break but I just didn't have the energy to do it
[2025/3/1 12:48:55] Sunaya: its always the case i had some stuff i wanted to do too but i got lazy and time j flew by
[2025/3/1 12:49:32] Eric Gao: yea true
[2025/3/1 12:50:13] Sunaya: are you using gcp?
[2025/3/1 12:50:20] Eric Gao: no using google colab
[2025/3/1 12:50:30] Sunaya: i mean gcp with colab
[2025/3/1 12:50:37] Eric Gao: no just colab
[2025/3/1 12:50:39] Sunaya: cause you get 300 free credit
[2025/3/1 12:50:52] Eric Gao: I'll probably start using that next time
[2025/3/1 12:50:58] Sunaya: and ive only spend 50 dollars so far with all the training ive done
[2025/3/1 12:51:02] Sunaya: yeah you should

[2025/3/1 12:52:23] Eric Gao: jus this one
[2025/3/1 12:52:31] Sunaya: also it is v likely that locally you have eer 3.5 but when you submit itll be 2.5 cause that happened for hanna
[2025/3/1 12:52:43] Eric Gao: oh that's cool
[2025/3/1 12:52:51] Sunaya: so i hope it works out for you

[2025/3/15 15:25:07] Eric Gao: Oh season 1?
[2025/3/15 15:25:17] Sunaya: i'm at 20 eps i think
[2025/3/15 15:25:18] Sunaya: yeah
[2025/3/15 15:25:21] Eric Gao: Ok
[2025/3/15 15:25:32] Eric Gao: I didn’t like it as much as I liked solo leveling
[2025/3/15 15:25:44] Sunaya: i have meeting with Gianni and i haven't looked at a single thing since the last meeting
[2025/3/15 15:25:55] Eric Gao: I think my all time favorite was overlord, did you watch this one?
[2025/3/15 15:26:02] Sunaya: yeah that's really good
[2025/3/15 15:26:07] Eric Gao: Lol I usually spend a fee hours before the meeting too
[2025/3/15 15:26:08] Sunaya: i liked it a lot too
[2025/3/15 15:26:42] Eric Gao: Yea it’s also like a cracked bro conquering the world
[2025/3/15 15:26:48] Sunaya: ther'es literally nothing to show for, i'll try to mash up something so it looks i did work
[2025/3/15 15:27:06] Sunaya: yeah it's a shame they take so long to release the new seasons
[2025/3/15 15:27:21] Sunaya: i think i read the light novel too but i completely forgot everything about ti
[2025/3/15 15:27:30] Sunaya: did you watch solo leveling new eps?
[2025/3/15 15:27:43] Sunaya: the next one will be the good one
[2025/3/15 15:28:10] Eric Gao: Lol good luck
[2025/3/15 15:28:16] Eric Gao: Yea I need one
[2025/3/15 15:28:26] Eric Gao: I heard it’s good
[2025/3/15 15:28:31] Eric Gao: Not yet
[2025/3/15 15:28:52] Sunaya: it's alright i thought the good part would happen but it seems it's the next eps
[2025/3/15 16:57:24] Eric Gao: Huh ok
[2025/3/16 04:05:26] Eric Gao: I watched solo leveling, I have a feeling that next one is gonna be good
[2025/3/16 04:06:24] Sunaya: Yeah it's gonna be so good
[2025/3/16 04:06:43] Sunaya: kinda wish they stopped before sung said exchange
[2025/3/16 04:06:52] Sunaya: and didn't show the shadow
[2025/3/16 04:07:31] Sunaya: also is it cold on campus/outside? i'm debating wearing a jacket
[2025/3/16 04:08:06] Eric Gao: This is why I know it’s gonna be good
[2025/3/16 04:08:40] Eric Gao: It’s warm not hot or cold, but I suggest bringing one in case it gets colder at night
[2025/3/16 04:08:56] Sunaya: ehh it's fine then

[2025/3/17 09:13:59] Sunaya: can you check of the sample solution is corrext
[2025/3/17 09:45:30] Eric Gao: ok let me check
[2025/3/17 09:50:54] Eric Gao: yea it passed everything
[2025/3/17 10:08:23] Sunaya: im sitll in oh
[2025/3/17 10:11:35] Eric Gao: damn
[2025/3/17 10:41:26] Sunaya: im about to finally leave now
[2025/3/17 11:14:28] Eric Gao: dan
[2025/3/17 16:06:09] Sunaya: ERIC
[2025/3/17 16:06:12] Sunaya: you awake?
[2025/3/17 16:06:19] Sunaya: pls be awake
[2025/3/17 16:06:21] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/3/17 16:06:35] Eric Gao: whatsup
[2025/3/17 16:06:50] Sunaya: i j arrived i have like 5 messages for help with the lab
[2025/3/17 16:06:55] Sunaya: they still haven't been able to fix it
[2025/3/17 16:06:57] Sunaya: idk what to do
[2025/3/17 16:07:00] Eric Gao: oh damn
[2025/3/17 16:07:12] Eric Gao: I mean it's outside your office hour
[2025/3/17 16:07:24] Sunaya: it is but i feel so bad
[2025/3/17 16:07:30] Sunaya: i stayed extra hours too
[2025/3/17 16:08:30] Eric Gao: ig just put the long code to chatgpt and ask it to summarize the steps in English
[2025/3/17 16:08:30] Sunaya: like idk how to help them nothing seems to work even though it's mostly all correct
[2025/3/17 16:09:00] Sunaya: the thing is they know what to do
[2025/3/17 16:09:08] Sunaya: and how it works
[2025/3/17 16:09:22] Sunaya: and i know what to do but it's the code that's j not working prolly something minor
[2025/3/17 16:13:05] Eric Gao: It’s fundamentally their homework still
[2025/3/17 16:13:11] Eric Gao: You already helped them as much as you can
[2025/3/17 16:14:12] Eric Gao: I think they shouldn’t get the marks unless they manually trace the failed simple testcase and figure out what’s wrong
[2025/3/17 16:15:13] Eric Gao: I think the issue is that we should not check their code. We already gave them the most detailed idea of how to solve it, and they should not rely on us to make the code work
[2025/3/17 16:17:28] Sunaya: true i think they are expecting too much from us. they almost have the same solution as sample, and I've already traced 4 different example graphs to help them understand what to do as well
[2025/3/17 16:18:17] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/3/17 16:18:22] Eric Gao: time to be the bad guy
[2025/3/17 16:18:47] Eric Gao: if they're whining here already they're not making it through algo
[2025/3/17 16:18:55] Eric Gao: or other cs electives
[2025/3/17 16:20:21] Sunaya: honestly ppl always get through
[2025/3/17 16:20:26] Sunaya: if Lorenzo can do it anyone can
[2025/3/17 16:21:41] Eric Gao: Yea lol
[2025/3/17 16:58:51] Sunaya: okay i managed to help at least one of them
[2025/3/17 16:59:02] Eric Gao: good
[2025/3/17 16:59:10] Sunaya: so im assuming it will propagate and theyll be done by tomorrow
[2025/3/17 17:01:50] Eric Gao: yea it should
[2025/3/18 08:43:15] Sunaya: found out its only 10 dollars a piece so thats not bad
[2025/3/18 08:47:47] Eric Gao: oh damn that's pretty good
[2025/3/19 11:14:19] Sunaya: eric did you renew your qid?

[2025/3/19 12:44:12] Eric Gao: Not yet

[2025/3/25 10:51:25] Eric Gao: the hotpot
[2025/3/25 10:54:40] Sunaya: we should do this again some time

[2025/3/25 10:56:14] Sunaya: what you say?
[2025/3/25 10:56:20] Sunaya: or we can do it in pitts
[2025/3/25 10:58:59] Eric Gao: Yea we should do it
[2025/3/25 10:59:08] Eric Gao: I wanna try bro, also the other nepali snacks
[2025/3/25 10:59:36] Sunaya: okok if we don't do it in Qatar we are definitely doing it in pitts
[2025/3/25 11:00:10] Eric Gao: yea def
[2025/3/27 09:51:50] Eric Gao: how's DL
[2025/3/27 09:52:11] Eric Gao: I'm having the same things as you, whenever I change my architecture it says CUDA error
[2025/3/27 12:53:09] Sunaya: resnet was worse
[2025/3/27 12:53:30] Sunaya: so im using the one for early submission but with a diff conv
[2025/3/27 12:53:34] Sunaya: its running rn
[2025/3/27 12:57:54] Eric Gao: Damn
[2025/3/27 13:02:29] Sunaya: it cause of the wrong shape remove the to.device and then run it
[2025/3/27 13:02:36] Sunaya: it will give you the actual error
[2025/3/27 13:02:43] Eric Gao: Oh okk
[2025/3/27 13:02:47] Sunaya: and the. you can put that in gpt and youll see what the problem
[2025/3/27 13:03:05] Sunaya: its usually that the x_len is of wrong size cause of downsampling
[2025/3/27 13:03:10] Eric Gao: hm okk
[2025/3/27 13:03:19] Eric Gao: also I heard talhah has 5.01 or something like that
[2025/3/27 13:03:48] Sunaya: i saw 5. something on laggle
[2025/3/27 13:03:58] Sunaya: the cutoff is 5 right?
[2025/3/27 13:05:57] Eric Gao: yes
[2025/3/27 13:06:15] Sunaya: when you submitted for early
[2025/3/27 13:06:32] Sunaya: was there a difference between your local and kaggle score cause of beam size
[2025/3/27 13:06:57] Eric Gao: I think a little bit, but not very big I think
[2025/3/27 13:07:04] Eric Gao: less than 0.5
[2025/3/27 13:07:05] Sunaya: i see
[2025/3/27 13:58:09] Sunaya: i had 6.9 locally and got 5.5 on kaggle
[2025/3/27 14:02:45] Sunaya: got this with my initial early cutoff code but with dropout added at every step
[2025/3/27 14:02:59] Sunaya: and using reduceLRonPlateau
[2025/3/27 14:05:20] Eric Gao: oh nice
[2025/3/27 14:05:29] Eric Gao: how many iters
[2025/3/27 14:06:29] Sunaya: 30
[2025/3/27 14:06:58] Sunaya: i'm gonna try to decrease the mlp size and increase the conv size and see if that makes a difference
[2025/3/27 14:07:20] Sunaya: 2 blstm and 2 pblstm
[2025/3/27 14:08:21] Eric Gao: okok
[2025/3/27 14:40:47] Sunaya: bro i changed my arch and now i'm getting inf loss
[2025/3/27 14:43:52] Eric Gao: lol my distance has been 60 for 4 iterations
[2025/3/27 14:46:23] Sunaya: was it always like that before?
[2025/3/27 14:55:53] Eric Gao: no I think it's new
[2025/3/27 14:56:12] Eric Gao: I made the decoder bigger
[2025/3/28 01:16:05] Sunaya: did it work?
[2025/3/28 01:19:47] Eric Gao: No it hasn’t
[2025/3/28 01:19:54] Eric Gao: It’s still 50 something
[2025/3/28 03:35:02] Sunaya: 50?
[2025/3/28 03:35:06] Sunaya: how come it's that big?
[2025/3/28 03:35:16] Sunaya: download the submission and look at the file
[2025/3/28 04:09:18] Eric Gao: I think I probly messed up my architecture
[2025/3/28 05:58:05] Eric Gao: your legs are also sore from archery?
[2025/3/28 05:58:18] Sunaya: yeah
[2025/3/28 05:58:30] Eric Gao: mien too
[2025/3/28 05:58:30] Sunaya: and i played tt yesterday too

[2025/3/28 05:58:36] Sunaya: i can't even squat now
[2025/3/28 05:58:41] Sunaya: hurts
[2025/3/28 05:58:51] Sunaya: i'm surprised it's so sore tho
[2025/3/28 05:59:02] Sunaya: we didn't really run that much
[2025/3/28 05:59:14] Eric Gao: yea idk what happened
[2025/3/28 05:59:23] Eric Gao: probably just didn't exercise for long
[2025/3/28 05:59:27] Sunaya: yeah most likely
[2025/3/28 05:59:32] Sunaya: i'll start running from now on
[2025/3/28 05:59:36] Sunaya: need to be fitter
[2025/3/28 05:59:40] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/3/28 05:59:53] Eric Gao: next sem let's hit the gym
[2025/3/28 06:00:09] Sunaya: aight
[2025/3/28 06:01:11] Sunaya: btw i'm running a model rn with very large embed size and it's doing good overall
[2025/3/28 06:01:50] Sunaya: i'll know more afer a couple of hours
[2025/3/28 06:02:36] Eric Gao: Ok that’s nice
‎[2025/3/28 06:23:27] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00013640-PHOTO-2025-03-28-06-23-27.jpg>
[2025/3/28 06:24:14] Sunaya: check your join
[2025/3/28 06:24:19] Sunaya: is it " ".join
[2025/3/28 06:24:22] Sunaya: or "".join
[2025/3/28 06:24:41] Sunaya: or maybe it's the network arch problem
[2025/3/28 06:25:47] Eric Gao: I checked that
[2025/3/28 06:25:49] Eric Gao: probably architecture
[2025/3/28 07:51:31] Eric Gao: I figured out why, my learning rate was too big
[2025/3/28 07:52:23] Sunaya: i see i see

[2025/3/28 09:33:02] Eric Gao: how's yours
[2025/3/28 09:51:47] Sunaya: that looks really good
[2025/3/28 09:52:42] Sunaya: it went below 6 but the loss is v higher
[2025/3/28 09:52:55] Sunaya: compared to when i had 6.9
[2025/3/28 09:53:11] Sunaya: and kaggle is stuck rn hopefully it gets unstuck
[2025/3/28 09:53:11] Eric Gao: hm that's good ig
[2025/3/28 09:53:24] Eric Gao: Kaggle only has p100 and it's so slow
[2025/3/28 09:53:30] Eric Gao: I just went back to collab and paid
[2025/3/28 09:53:40] Sunaya: but your loss looks good you might get below 5 even tho local is 6

[2025/3/28 10:59:38] Eric Gao: Yes
[2025/3/28 10:59:47] Eric Gao: It’s from your code
[2025/3/28 10:59:48] Sunaya: what's your patience and stuff

[2025/4/14 14:46:52] Eric Gao: only that person can jerk off you know
[2025/4/14 14:47:11] Sunaya: tim said he snores and if the other person is fine witb it hes fine with being in double
[2025/4/14 14:47:24] Sunaya: so we were like we can always switch who gets the single
[2025/4/14 14:47:39] Eric Gao: hmm
[2025/4/14 14:47:43] Sunaya: or if somone has a girl over and NEEEDS the single lol
[2025/4/14 14:47:56] Eric Gao: oh yea true
[2025/4/14 14:48:11] Eric Gao: you should probably have the single room
[2025/4/14 14:48:11] Sunaya: and we even were trying to see if we could bring a bed out in the living room so everone is seperate
[2025/4/14 14:48:41] Sunaya: in any way i think this the best option
[2025/4/14 14:49:24] Eric Gao: ok sounds good
[2025/4/14 14:49:29] Sunaya: https://www.vividmediavirtualtours.com/3d-model/cmu-fairfax-x01-apartment-single-double/fullscreen/
[2025/4/14 14:49:32] Sunaya: this is how it looks btw
[2025/4/14 14:50:40] Eric Gao: ok looks nice
[2025/4/14 14:51:04] Sunaya: i was surprised how close the doubles were the first time i saw
[2025/4/14 14:51:17] Sunaya: almost as if we are sleeping in a same bed
[2025/4/14 14:51:19] Sunaya: eye to eye
[2025/4/14 14:51:24] Sunaya: haha
[2025/4/14 14:51:43] Eric Gao: yea no staring at each other when jerking off
[2025/4/14 14:51:43] Sunaya: you and haolin stayed in the doubles too right?
[2025/4/14 14:51:58] Eric Gao: yea but it was much larger, like twice as large
[2025/4/14 14:52:12] Sunaya: was it Fairfax too?
[2025/4/14 14:52:15] Eric Gao: I can't really see him when we're sleeping
[2025/4/14 14:52:19] Sunaya: no way
[2025/4/14 14:52:22] Eric Gao: no, it's forbes beeler
[2025/4/14 14:52:28] Sunaya: ohhhh

[2025/4/14 14:53:05] Sunaya: i'm surprised how did you get in that one
[2025/4/14 14:53:25] Sunaya: was it cause there wasn't Fairfax for exchange before
[2025/4/14 14:58:16] Eric Gao: I don't really know
[2025/4/14 14:58:26] Sunaya: quick question
[2025/4/14 14:58:40] Sunaya: do you know the room next to networks lab
[2025/4/14 14:58:48] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/4/14 14:58:50] Sunaya: the one with the round table
[2025/4/14 14:59:01] Eric Gao: 2051
[2025/4/14 14:59:07] Eric Gao: or 2049
[2025/4/14 14:59:12] Eric Gao: which one are you talking about?
[2025/4/14 14:59:25] Sunaya: ig both should be fine
[2025/4/14 14:59:34] Eric Gao: yea they're pretty much the same

[2025/4/21 09:18:16] Sunaya: now i have a cer that's too big
[2025/4/21 09:22:36] Eric Gao: hm
[2025/4/21 09:22:54] Eric Gao: bro colab is taking 15 minutes per epoch too
[2025/4/21 09:23:34] Eric Gao: 10 dollars only can run like 14 hours, which is 56 epochs
[2025/4/21 15:55:37] Sunaya: BRO
[2025/4/21 15:55:40] Sunaya: how's the model doing
[2025/4/21 15:55:46] Sunaya: also i decided to change my decode
[2025/4/21 15:55:49] Sunaya: oh i mean beam
[2025/4/21 15:55:56] Sunaya: lol gonna follow the pseudo code
[2025/4/21 16:01:39] Eric Gao: it somehow died during archery
[2025/4/21 16:01:42] Eric Gao: I retrained the model
[2025/4/21 16:01:47] Sunaya: i see
[2025/4/21 16:01:51] Eric Gao: it's at epoch 8
[2025/4/21 16:02:03] Eric Gao: cer is 77.5 now
[2025/4/21 16:02:03] Sunaya: yknow even inference takes a long as time
[2025/4/21 16:02:09] Sunaya: that's so hihg
[2025/4/21 16:02:13] Eric Gao: yea I tried it takes 30min or smth
[2025/4/21 16:02:22] Sunaya: mines  running for 2 hrs lol
[2025/4/21 16:02:24] Sunaya: j inference
[2025/4/21 16:02:28] Eric Gao: damn
[2025/4/21 16:02:42] Sunaya: too many ppl in deepnet
[2025/4/21 16:02:57] Sunaya: but if i get med cutoff i think i'll be ahppy
[2025/4/21 16:03:03] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/4/21 16:03:08] Sunaya: i'll try high cutoff but idk man traiing takes wayyy too long
[2025/4/21 16:03:09] Eric Gao: what's your cer right now
[2025/4/21 16:03:16] Eric Gao: how many epochs has it been
[2025/4/21 16:03:20] Sunaya: it was 17? 18 i think
[2025/4/21 16:03:24] Sunaya: 78
[2025/4/21 16:03:28] Sunaya: 78 epoch
[2025/4/21 16:03:28] Eric Gao: oh
[2025/4/21 16:03:34] Eric Gao: damn that's good
[2025/4/21 16:03:41] Sunaya: but i did progressive training where you freeze and unfreeze layers
[2025/4/21 16:03:47] Eric Gao: uhh
[2025/4/21 16:03:52] Sunaya: it's on the handout
[2025/4/21 16:03:53] Sunaya: dont' do it
[2025/4/21 16:03:57] Sunaya: useless ass shit
[2025/4/21 16:04:01] Sunaya: unless you fully understand it
[2025/4/21 16:04:46] Sunaya: anyhow i asked hanna she basically didn't change anything not even the scheduler, only changed the number of encoders and decoder and then like added those maksing ans stuff and droupout
[2025/4/21 16:04:59] Sunaya: she ran for less than 50 epoch and got the high cutoff
[2025/4/21 16:05:07] Sunaya: so yeah
[2025/4/21 16:05:11] Sunaya: i'm gonna be doing that now
[2025/4/21 16:05:18] Sunaya: once the inference is done
[2025/4/21 16:06:45] Eric Gao: whaatt
[2025/4/21 16:06:57] Sunaya: yeah
[2025/4/21 16:07:00] Eric Gao: that sounds so easy tho
[2025/4/21 16:07:03] Sunaya: it is
[2025/4/21 16:07:43] Sunaya: even i had 18 cer when i had that config without using progressive, for 28 epoch
[2025/4/21 16:08:00] Sunaya: should've j continued with this
[2025/4/21 16:08:14] Eric Gao: dam
[2025/4/21 16:08:17] Sunaya: by that i mean the 12 encoder and 8 decoder
[2025/4/21 16:08:27] Eric Gao: why the heck is mine 70 something
[2025/4/21 16:08:34] Eric Gao: was it like that for you too?
[2025/4/21 16:08:37] Sunaya: wait lemme see how much i had
[2025/4/21 16:09:13] Sunaya: https://wandb.ai/idl_cmu/hw4p2-ablations?nw=nwusersunaya
[2025/4/21 16:09:17] Sunaya: can you open?
[2025/4/21 16:09:43] Sunaya: HighRun was the first run with the normal thingy
[2025/4/21 16:09:50] Sunaya: Hii Run is the ass progressive thingy
[2025/4/21 16:10:37] Eric Gao: ok fair yours was 60 something at 8th epoch
[2025/4/21 16:12:39] Sunaya: only thing is idk what scheduler is good for tranformers
[2025/4/21 16:12:52] Eric Gao: yea no idea about it
[2025/4/21 16:12:53] Sunaya: everytime the learning rate increases the cer increases
[2025/4/21 16:13:03] Eric Gao: proly steplr
[2025/4/21 16:13:12] Eric Gao: I tried steplr but it errors on plot training rate
[2025/4/21 16:13:23] Sunaya: feel like if we have a good scheduler it'll be easier
[2025/4/21 16:13:36] Eric Gao: yea probably
[2025/4/22 01:58:57] Eric Gao: My model is 30 epochs and cer is 19
[2025/4/22 01:59:06] Sunaya: my new model
[2025/4/22 01:59:09] Sunaya: is guess what
[2025/4/22 01:59:13] Eric Gao: Qhat

[2025/4/22 02:00:17] Sunaya: i changed from 5K to char
[2025/4/22 02:00:26] Eric Gao: Lol
[2025/4/22 02:00:35] Sunaya: since we use characters for difference
[2025/4/22 02:00:45] Eric Gao: That’s smart
[2025/4/22 02:01:31] Sunaya: and i'm using coisen_warm
[2025/4/22 02:01:38] Eric Gao: Okk
[2025/4/22 02:01:41] Eric Gao: Lmk how it goes
[2025/4/22 02:02:04] Sunaya: also do you know if their load the best metric model works properly?
[2025/4/22 02:02:20] Eric Gao: I have no idea
[2025/4/22 02:02:46] Sunaya: i looked at the code seems correct, but idk when i loaded the best metric, it was kinda ass on Kaggle compare to local
[2025/4/22 02:02:52] Sunaya: local was like 16 Kaggle was 18
[2025/4/22 02:02:59] Sunaya: usually it's the other way round
[2025/4/22 02:03:31] Sunaya: man i'd have done 20 epoch by now if it' wasn't for someone hogging deepnet for smt that's not IDL
[2025/4/22 02:04:03] Eric Gao: Lol report him bro

[2025/4/22 03:47:23] Eric Gao: my learning rate will decrease for the next 10 epochs, I hope it will get there
[2025/4/22 03:51:16] Sunaya: i see yeah it should go lowe now
[2025/4/22 03:52:27] Eric Gao: hopeful

[2025/4/25 06:41:10] Eric Gao: I don’t think so.. these look too low. My first epoch got prrplexity 10 or smth
[2025/4/25 06:41:21] Sunaya: yeah exactly
[2025/4/25 06:41:28] Sunaya: i'm tryna see where i may have made an error
[2025/4/25 06:48:10] Eric Gao: Might be your loss function or smth
[2025/4/25 06:50:22] Sunaya: i'm trying to see
[2025/4/25 06:50:26] Sunaya: but those were given to us
[2025/4/25 06:51:55] Eric Gao: Hmm
[2025/4/25 07:48:25] Sunaya: i checked and it doesn't seems liek anything is wrong in trainer
[2025/4/25 07:48:39] Sunaya: maybe some other function which passes but some edge case
[2025/4/25 07:50:32] Eric Gao: maybe the generator is wrong?
[2025/4/25 07:50:45] Sunaya: but its' the same for p2
[2025/4/25 07:50:50] Sunaya: so couldn't be

[2025/4/25 09:17:54] Sunaya: but do you know how they check in autograder
[2025/4/25 09:18:06] Sunaya: they j look at the json and compare the values
[2025/4/25 09:18:25] Sunaya: the json of loss and stuff, so if you manually change that file to have lesser value that works too

[2025/6/19 05:52:20] Sunaya: yeah
[2025/6/19 05:52:31] Sunaya: the most important thing is choosing a right advisor
[2025/6/19 05:52:37] Sunaya: cause you're stuck with him for the rest of your phd
[2025/6/19 05:52:44] Eric Gao: Good good
[2025/6/19 05:53:57] Eric Gao: I’m not 100% sure about that.. tbh I haven’t explored many fields either. I just came back from the icc conference and even in that conference there’s at least 17 tracks of different research topics
[2025/6/19 05:54:08] Eric Gao: True true
[2025/6/19 05:54:32] Sunaya: right!!! man i wish our cs currilum exposed us to more variety of CS stuff
[2025/6/19 05:54:36] Sunaya: we did too much algorithms
[2025/6/19 05:54:50] Sunaya: 112 -> 122 -> 150 -> 210 -> 451
[2025/6/19 05:54:59] Sunaya: they were all mostly the same thing
[2025/6/19 05:55:01] Eric Gao: Yea that’s true, what we learn in undergrad are foundations but doesn’t really reflect life
[2025/6/19 05:55:26] Sunaya: yeah the one course i'd say was good is computer systems
[2025/6/19 05:55:41] Sunaya: there was a lot of stuff
[2025/6/19 05:55:48] Sunaya: wish there were more courses like that
[2025/6/19 05:55:51] Eric Gao: Yea true
[2025/6/19 05:55:58] Sunaya: in the core
[2025/6/19 05:56:17] Eric Gao: Let’s go around and talk to professors in Pittsburgh
[2025/6/19 05:56:22] Sunaya: yeah 100%
[2025/6/19 05:56:23] Eric Gao: They should know more
[2025/6/19 05:56:45] Eric Gao: Also just saw news that trump released visa applications, did you get an appointment ?
[2025/6/19 05:56:49] Sunaya: i'm going to hone in too and figure out atleast a couple of sub areas so it's more organized
[2025/6/19 05:56:59] Eric Gao: Sounds good
[2025/6/19 05:57:18] Sunaya: yeah i saw, it's still not open here. I think they gave 5 days for embassies to like get ready and open up so i'm waiting
[2025/6/19 05:57:22] Sunaya: but everything should be good
[2025/6/19 05:57:33] Sunaya: even if they check my online activity
[2025/6/19 05:57:39] Sunaya: which is sort of non existent
[2025/6/19 05:57:42] Eric Gao: Oh Okk that’s nice, lmk how things go
[2025/6/19 05:57:44] Eric Gao: Lol
[2025/6/19 05:59:00] Sunaya: yup
[2025/6/19 05:59:07] Sunaya: i'll let you know what i end up choosing too
[2025/6/19 05:59:24] Sunaya: and if i find any interesting research in different fields during my search
[2025/6/19 06:00:15] Eric Gao: Okk
[2025/6/19 06:00:24] Eric Gao: The hot topic right now is ai
[2025/6/19 06:00:39] Sunaya: haha yeah it's been AI for a while now
[2025/6/19 06:00:49] Sunaya: almost anything i do has some sort of AI
[2025/6/19 06:00:59] Sunaya: qcri, Gianni, even now
[2025/6/19 06:01:07] Eric Gao: Oh here are the notes I took from the conference with some research topics, feel free to check it out https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bEZf1wWsYQXMnLZPcSlb4AdrPA4-RlF312UE05j5Lq4/edit?usp=sharing
[2025/6/19 06:01:52] Sunaya: Oooo nice thanks a lot
[2025/6/19 06:05:31] Sunaya: also from reddit and the internet a lot of ppl say most time the field is what chooses you rather than you choosing it
[2025/6/19 06:06:17] Sunaya: lots of example of people choosing what they want to do from the first internship they did or the first paper they wrote
[2025/6/19 06:07:04] Eric Gao: Hmm
[2025/6/19 06:07:16] Eric Gao: Yea I think that’s common
[2025/6/20 02:21:26] Sunaya: i booked appointment on 30 th June
[2025/6/20 02:21:28] Sunaya: it opened today
[2025/6/20 02:21:38] Sunaya: i checked at 11:30 wasn't open
[2025/6/20 02:21:52] Sunaya: it opened at 11:45
[2025/6/20 02:50:17] Eric Gao: oh that's great
[2025/6/20 02:50:26] Eric Gao: hope everything goes well!
[2025/6/20 02:50:41] Eric Gao: I didn't expect them to go so fast
[2025/6/20 02:51:04] Sunaya: and good thing here is theres so mmy dates

[2025/6/20 02:51:48] Eric Gao: oh damn that's nice
[2025/6/20 02:51:57] Eric Gao: I saw a news that Chinese students are in huge lines for student visa
[2025/6/20 02:52:14] Sunaya: yeah its prolly the same in a lot of places
[2025/6/20 02:52:23] Sunaya: since they were closed for almost a month
[2025/6/20 02:52:29] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/6/20 02:52:47] Eric Gao: there's only 3 or 4 embassies in China and too many people who want to go to us
[2025/6/20 02:53:00] Sunaya: only 3-4 is so little for chiba
[2025/6/20 02:53:07] Eric Gao: my mom tried to book a visa appointment around a month ago and the closest date was october
[2025/6/20 02:53:14] Sunaya: damn
[2025/6/20 02:53:27] Sunaya: 3-4 is j too little
[2025/6/20 02:53:50] Sunaya: i wonder how the social media vetting is gonna go
[2025/6/20 02:54:08] Sunaya: i havent posted anything really so theres nothing much
[2025/6/20 02:54:13] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/6/20 02:54:33] Eric Gao: just delete your social media before you go ig
[2025/6/20 02:54:58] Sunaya: also from what i heard its mostly for ppl who they can infer might side with palestine
[2025/6/20 02:55:29] Sunaya: nepalese dont really advocate and rally
[2025/6/20 02:55:39] Sunaya: even in the US so it shoulf be fine
[2025/6/20 02:55:49] Eric Gao: yea

[2025/6/23 09:03:34] Sunaya: haha i don't think anything would happen in Qatar though
[2025/6/23 09:04:11] Eric Gao: the largest base is here tho
[2025/6/23 09:04:16] Sunaya: oh what

[2025/6/23 09:04:47] Sunaya: wait so you can't go to campus to work anymore?
[2025/6/23 09:05:13] Eric Gao: yea probably nt
[2025/6/23 09:05:25] Sunaya: iran wouldn't want to do anything to Qatar though
[2025/6/23 09:05:58] Sunaya: i wonder if iran can do anything at all
[2025/6/23 09:06:07] Eric Gao: I think iran and Qatar doesn't have a good relationship
[2025/6/23 09:06:24] Sunaya: damn i though all muslim were like good with each other
[2025/6/23 09:06:59] Eric Gao: nah man
[2025/6/23 09:07:01] Sunaya: if anything does happen we can study both our sem in the US

‎[2025/6/23 09:07:42] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00015188-PHOTO-2025-06-23-09-07-42.jpg>
[2025/6/23 09:08:11] Sunaya: that means Qatar and Iran good right
[2025/6/23 09:08:13] Eric Gao: yea ig
[2025/6/23 09:08:17] Eric Gao: I thought they were bad, nv
[2025/6/23 09:08:18] Eric Gao: m
[2025/6/23 09:08:27] Eric Gao: lol we might get stuck there too
[2025/6/23 09:08:39] Sunaya: oh yeah
[2025/6/23 09:08:58] Sunaya: but i don't really think it'll develop into a big thing
[2025/6/23 09:09:10] Sunaya: these things usually sizzle down after a couple of days
[2025/6/23 09:09:25] Sunaya: a bit of bombing here and there
[2025/6/23 09:09:29] Sunaya: like with india and Pakistan
[2025/6/23 09:09:46] Eric Gao: hopefully lol
[2025/6/23 09:10:04] Eric Gao: if I were iran I'd be pretty pissed tho
[2025/6/23 09:10:15] Eric Gao: what more can a losing country lose
[2025/6/23 09:10:28] Sunaya: yeah, but like i don't see what more they can do
[2025/6/23 09:10:35] Eric Gao: they probably still have nuke
[2025/6/23 09:10:37] Sunaya: isreal and US have too much militart might
[2025/6/23 09:10:53] Sunaya: Nah tulsi gabbard and the intelligence have said time and again that they don't have nuclear weapons
[2025/6/23 09:11:02] Eric Gao: oh that's a relief then
[2025/6/23 09:11:10] Sunaya: even the nulear sites that was destroyed didn't have nuclear readings
[2025/6/23 09:11:16] Sunaya: so most likely there weren't any
[2025/6/23 09:11:28] Eric Gao: oh ok
[2025/6/23 09:11:46] Sunaya: all i can see happening is some terror attacks
[2025/6/23 09:11:59] Sunaya: or bombing like concerts and stuff
[2025/6/23 09:12:05] Sunaya: so we gotta be careful when in the US
[2025/6/23 09:13:55] Eric Gao: yea true
[2025/6/23 09:15:45] Eric Gao: no concert

[2025/7/5 08:51:04] Sunaya: and they give you corn too

[2025/7/5 08:51:16] Eric Gao: On nice that’s healthier
[2025/7/5 08:51:51] Sunaya: i think it's similar in china too right
[2025/7/5 08:52:04] Eric Gao: No we have fries
[2025/7/5 08:52:21] Sunaya: but you can substitute corn no?
[2025/7/5 08:52:30] Eric Gao: But there’s more local food like KFC would serve Zongzi in dragon boat festival and they have porridge for breakfast
[2025/7/5 08:52:34] Sunaya: here fries too but can be swapped
[2025/7/5 08:52:38] Eric Gao: I don’t think so, not that I know of

[2025/7/5 08:55:17] Sunaya: i see
[2025/7/5 08:55:27] Sunaya: damn when i come china ig i'll have to try the cherries
[2025/7/5 08:55:50] Eric Gao: yea almost all agricultural stuff is great, the only problem is that too many people pretend bad stuff to be good stuff
[2025/7/5 08:55:59] Sunaya: i see i see
[2025/7/5 08:56:06] Sunaya: and most of it is grown in china too right
[2025/7/5 08:56:07] Eric Gao: there's some shops in Shanghai where you can get 4 tomatoes for like 50 riyals, but you'll know they're good
[2025/7/5 08:56:14] Sunaya: so that automatically makes it so much better
[2025/7/5 08:56:15] Eric Gao: yea
[2025/7/5 08:56:29] Sunaya: i ate some Chinese grapes too and they were so good
[2025/7/5 08:56:32] Sunaya: almost like candies
[2025/7/5 08:57:02] Eric Gao: the reason I don't like grapes is also because they're always too sweet lol
[2025/7/5 08:57:16] Sunaya: ahahaha, yeah too sweet is no good
[2025/7/5 08:57:24] Sunaya: there needs to be a bit of tartness
[2025/7/5 08:57:27] Sunaya: or sourness
[2025/7/5 08:57:37] Sunaya: those are the ones i like the mosst
[2025/7/5 08:57:49] Eric Gao: True

[2025/7/5 08:58:55] Sunaya: i see

[2025/7/5 08:59:24] Sunaya: true, idk how i feel about them after Qatar tho
[2025/7/5 08:59:37] Sunaya: i used to love pineapples too but Qatar ones make me think twice
[2025/7/5 08:59:50] Eric Gao: Yea I didn’t really have good fruits in qatar
[2025/7/5 08:59:51] Sunaya: they were so sour and hurt your tongue
[2025/7/5 09:00:06] Eric Gao: People in China would just throw that kind of fruits to pigs
[2025/7/5 09:00:28] Sunaya: yeah honestly not one fruit was good in qatar

[2025/7/5 09:01:26] Eric Gao: My dad hates the smell but my mom likes them
[2025/7/5 09:01:36] Eric Gao: I’m neutral

[2025/7/5 09:02:23] Sunaya: almost like a human made custard
[2025/7/5 09:02:37] Eric Gao: Yea good ones taste really soft and sweet
[2025/7/5 09:02:42] Sunaya: but the smell is so overwhelming that sometimes you feel like puking
[2025/7/5 09:02:52] Eric Gao: True
[2025/7/5 09:03:07] Sunaya: yeah i tried the most premium ones here, cost me like $50 and they were v good
[2025/7/5 09:03:16] Sunaya: but i had a hard time finishing it
[2025/7/5 09:03:25] Sunaya: couldn't make myself eat it
[2025/7/5 09:03:40] Sunaya: cause of the smell
[2025/7/5 09:03:59] Eric Gao: Nice nice

[2025/7/5 09:05:25] Sunaya: i made sure there were spaced repetitions so i don't forget the taste
[2025/7/5 09:05:37] Eric Gao: Damn you’re gonna smell like it
[2025/7/5 09:05:52] Sunaya: and every time i tried to describe it i j couldn't say exactly what it taste like
[2025/7/5 09:06:08] Sunaya: yeah the poop smelled like that too
[2025/7/5 09:06:11] Eric Gao: Some people say it has the taste of all fruits
[2025/7/5 09:06:21] Eric Gao: Lol
[2025/7/5 09:06:34] Sunaya: if you think about it there a bit of garlicy/ charred onion tasste too

[2025/7/5 09:07:43] Sunaya: oh yeah
[2025/7/5 09:07:59] Sunaya: i couldn't try it cause of the smell that time
[2025/7/5 09:08:04] Sunaya: but i think now i can do it
[2025/7/5 09:08:39] Eric Gao: There’s durian candy too
[2025/7/5 09:08:49] Eric Gao: Probably durain mixed with milk or something, chewy

‎[2025/7/8 08:54:19] Sunaya:‎<附件：00015628-PHOTO-2025-07-08-08-54-19.jpg>
[2025/7/8 08:54:21] Eric Gao: No other airlines?
[2025/7/8 08:54:33] Sunaya: there are
[2025/7/8 08:54:38] Sunaya: and they're a lot cheaper i think
[2025/7/8 08:54:42] Eric Gao: Scared of plane crash?
[2025/7/8 08:54:49] Sunaya: yeah
[2025/7/8 08:55:10] Sunaya: there's one from air india
‎[2025/7/8 08:56:28] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00015635-PHOTO-2025-07-08-08-56-28.jpg>
[2025/7/8 08:56:51] Eric Gao: I see a turkish airlines for 1250usd
[2025/7/8 08:57:05] Eric Gao: But it’s 41h
[2025/7/8 08:57:21] Eric Gao: One night layover in istanbul
[2025/7/8 08:57:28] Sunaya: ahahahha
[2025/7/8 08:57:41] Sunaya: hopefully the missiles don't land there
[2025/7/8 08:57:55] Eric Gao: The UAE airlines is 32h and around 1500 usd
[2025/7/8 08:57:59] Eric Gao: Lol
[2025/7/8 08:58:15] Sunaya: why is it all so expensive
[2025/7/8 08:58:26] Sunaya: how much is yours
[2025/7/8 08:58:31] Eric Gao: Around 1250
[2025/7/8 08:58:41] Sunaya: oh that's not too bad
[2025/7/8 08:58:48] Sunaya: since we're both at like similar distance
[2025/7/8 08:59:29] Eric Gao: Cheapest one I found from China is around 1000
[2025/7/8 08:59:34] Eric Gao: Yea
[2025/7/8 08:59:50] Sunaya: OH DMANNNNN
[2025/7/8 09:00:26] Eric Gao: But that’s leaving from hongkong and I probably need to apply for an entry permit first
[2025/7/8 09:00:40] Sunaya: that's crazy though even for just a layover
[2025/7/8 09:00:42] Sunaya: you need a permit?
[2025/7/8 09:00:53] Sunaya: and you're Chinese too
[2025/7/8 09:01:08] Eric Gao: Yea probably
[2025/7/8 09:01:16] Eric Gao: No I meant leave feom there
[2025/7/8 09:01:21] Sunaya: ohhhh
[2025/7/8 09:01:23] Sunaya: i see
[2025/7/8 09:02:17] Sunaya: but that's crazy tho, like hk and china are like one
[2025/7/8 09:02:40] Sunaya: even if it's different countries feel like china should get special treatment
[2025/7/8 09:03:40] Eric Gao: yea we do
[2025/7/8 09:03:45] Eric Gao: it's complicated
[2025/7/8 09:34:06] Sunaya: i heard it's hard for Chinese to go to Taiwan too
[2025/7/8 09:34:08] Sunaya: is that true?
[2025/7/8 09:34:29] Eric Gao: probably yea
[2025/7/8 09:34:42] Eric Gao: never tried doing that but there has been political stuff happening
[2025/7/8 09:35:00] Sunaya: jesus i don't understand
[2025/7/8 09:35:08] Sunaya: they're all Chinese
[2025/7/8 09:35:15] Sunaya: it's all cause of the US and UK
[2025/7/8 09:35:24] Eric Gao: yea western politics certainly did something there
[2025/7/8 09:35:44] Eric Gao: there's also some histories of the Chinese civil war, because it's said that the party that lost in the civil war went to taiwan
[2025/7/8 09:35:58] Sunaya: ahh i see
[2025/7/8 09:36:29] Sunaya: but it's crazy how hard working Chinese are, a lot of the places they've gone to it's all been really great
[2025/7/8 09:36:40] Sunaya: like tiwan, hk, china, singapore
[2025/7/8 09:37:04] Eric Gao: I mean most people think that there's not much meaningful things to do other than working
[2025/7/8 09:38:01] Sunaya: hmm i see
‎[2025/7/8 10:30:02] Eric Gao:‎<附件：00015677-PHOTO-2025-07-08-10-30-02.jpg>

[2025/7/8 10:30:51] Sunaya: is it live?
[2025/7/8 10:31:06] Eric Gao: I think it's high res video
[2025/7/8 10:31:21] Eric Gao: it also plays radio music you can listen to, so it's like you're driving there
[2025/7/8 10:32:07] Sunaya: wait what how does this work
[2025/7/8 10:32:24] Sunaya: it's not live right
[2025/7/8 10:32:47] Sunaya: prolly pre recoded video of someone who went to nepal to collecet data for this
[2025/7/8 10:32:54] Eric Gao: yea it's probably recorded

[2025/7/8 10:33:09] Sunaya: this i sinsane tho
[2025/7/8 10:33:10] Sunaya: yeah
[2025/7/8 10:33:15] Eric Gao: probably will help do research about grad school programs
[2025/7/8 10:33:39] Sunaya: if you click the same city multiple times it gives different locations in the city too
[2025/7/8 10:33:45] Sunaya: i'm surprised there's something like this
[2025/7/8 10:34:06] Eric Gao: oh nice I didn't notice that
[2025/7/8 10:34:35] Sunaya: nahh this is crazy there's so many locations for kathmandu
[2025/7/8 10:35:08] Sunaya: there's Bhutan too
[2025/7/8 10:35:13] Eric Gao: damn
[2025/7/8 10:35:25] Sunaya: north korea too
[2025/7/8 10:35:47] Eric Gao: I was just about to say that lol
‎[2025/7/8 10:37:35] Sunaya:‎<附件：00015699-PHOTO-2025-07-08-10-37-35.jpg>
[2025/7/8 10:38:16] Sunaya: and made like a list of things i found interesting while looking at that
‎[2025/7/8 10:38:20] Sunaya:‎<附件：00015701-PHOTO-2025-07-08-10-38-20.jpg>
[2025/7/8 10:39:40] Sunaya: i prolly could've been more organized and made it better but i'm only looking at it broadly until i find something to go deeper
[2025/7/8 10:51:58] Eric Gao: damn that's almost done
[2025/7/8 10:52:08] Eric Gao: cool cool
[2025/7/8 11:01:49] Sunaya: i left the most interesting part for the end
[2025/7/8 11:02:47] Sunaya: the rest i knew i woulnt really do much but still wanted to see what there was
[2025/7/8 11:03:19] Eric Gao: probably good idea
[2025/7/8 11:03:38] Sunaya: almost everything i looked at the new research in yhe field theres always something to do related to ML/AI
[2025/7/8 11:05:13] Eric Gao: yea that's the trend
[2025/7/9 07:12:43] Sunaya: you double chexked with juan that your f1 visa would still be valid right

[2025/7/20 03:13:51] Sunaya: eric what cologne do you use

[2025/7/20 03:14:28] Sunaya: idk if its j my nose
[2025/7/20 03:16:39] Eric Gao: My favorites are Gucci Guilty and Versace Eros series
[2025/7/20 03:17:02] Eric Gao: The versace one is stronger, and gucci is weaker
[2025/7/20 03:17:45] Eric Gao: I haven’t really used other brands much. I experimented with arab perfume and I didn’t like it, and perfumes from cheaper shops don’t last long
[2025/7/20 03:18:15] Eric Gao: Penhaligon has some nice perfumes too
[2025/7/20 03:18:22] Sunaya: i see i see ill try these and see
[2025/7/20 03:19:42] Sunaya: have you tried LV imagination?
[2025/7/20 03:20:18] Eric Gao: Other men luxury shops like Amarni Boss Montblanc should have nice ones too
[2025/7/20 03:20:29] Eric Gao: No I haven’t
[2025/7/20 03:20:42] Sunaya: yeah ive heard about armanis stronger with you a lot ill try that too
[2025/7/20 03:20:58] Eric Gao: Good good
[2025/7/20 03:21:11] Eric Gao: Chanel probably has men perfume too
[2025/7/20 03:21:33] Sunaya: have you heard about the last birthday cake perfume
[2025/7/20 03:21:58] Sunaya: it a super niche perfume and has a whole story but its extremely hard to find
[2025/7/20 03:22:17] Eric Gao: Interesting, I never really heard of ig
[2025/7/20 03:22:44] Eric Gao: Why suddenly looking for perfume
[2025/7/20 03:23:48] Sunaya: never really wore any but i figured i should
[2025/7/20 03:24:14] Sunaya: it j came to me
[2025/7/20 03:24:29] Eric Gao: Makes sense
[2025/7/20 03:24:43] Sunaya: and then i went into the loop of look at them
[2025/7/26 12:00:43] Sunaya: are you planning on doing a honor thesis or not?
[2025/7/26 12:12:00] Eric Gao: I was waiting for prof riley to send oht an email
[2025/7/26 12:12:11] Eric Gao: Khaled already asked me to do it
[2025/7/26 12:12:28] Sunaya: wait so what courses are you gonna do next sem?
[2025/7/26 12:12:33] Eric Gao: And I can probably just replace a systems course with the honors thesis
[2025/7/26 12:13:13] Sunaya: its' 36 units right
[2025/7/26 12:14:19] Sunaya: 18 each sem
[2025/7/26 12:16:35] Sunaya: also you're planning to do it on what you're working on right now right?
[2025/7/26 12:16:46] Eric Gao: Yes
[2025/7/26 12:17:32] Eric Gao: I’m 80-90% done with the current work, khaled has a new project coming up too
[2025/7/26 12:17:41] Sunaya: i see i see
[2025/7/26 12:18:05] Sunaya: wait so you'd be doing 3 course + honor for the next two sem
[2025/7/26 12:18:32] Sunaya: or 3 + honor, and 4 + honor

[2025/8/20 11:03:17] Eric Gao: If it makes anxiety high
[2025/8/20 11:33:44] Sunaya: ahahaha it's like increases anxity initially and then once your body is adjusted to it then it works
[2025/8/20 11:34:13] Sunaya: but sometimes the medication only increases anxiety even after a while and that is when you know that the medicine doesn't suit you and that you have to change medication

[2025/8/20 13:40:47] Eric Gao: Yea I just thought we’ll be on campus pretty much the whole time and the only times we need data is probably checking maps

[2025/8/20 13:42:29] Eric Gao: Still issuing
[2025/8/20 13:42:52] Eric Gao: oh btw did you get your TB blood test done
[2025/8/20 13:44:02] Eric Gao: I did it in Qatar about a month ago. Before they told me I can receive the report via text, but now they are making me pick up the report in person. I'll  do it again this afternoon in the UHS on campus
[2025/8/20 13:44:39] Sunaya: oh yeah i did it in nepal cheap and quick got the result in a day
[2025/8/20 13:44:42] Sunaya: oh WHAY
[2025/8/20 13:45:02] Sunaya: cant they j send it over?
[2025/8/20 13:45:13] Sunaya: and can someone else pick up or has to be you
[2025/8/20 13:45:16] Eric Gao: shit man the Qatar one costed 800 riyals, I called 10 hospitals and only one was taking insurance and htat's the one I wnet to
[2025/8/20 13:45:33] Eric Gao: they said someone with blood relation to me, and they need to bring the proof that they are
[2025/8/20 13:46:05] Sunaya: thats crazy it cost me 50 qar total no insurance
[2025/8/20 13:46:06] Eric Gao: at this point I don't care anymore man, it's just another few milliliters of blood drawn away
[2025/8/20 13:46:13] Eric Gao: fuck so cheap
[2025/8/20 13:46:20] Eric Gao: the price at the QF cliinc was 2000 riyals
[2025/8/20 13:46:33] Sunaya: yeah healthcare in nepal is extremely cheap no one buys insurance
[2025/8/20 13:46:41] Sunaya: no one in my family has insurance
[2025/8/20 13:47:23] Eric Gao: damn that's crazy
[2025/8/20 13:47:48] Eric Gao: in China everyone has public insurance, and majority of the people also buy private insurance
[2025/8/20 13:48:02] Sunaya: i see
[2025/8/20 13:48:06] Eric Gao: but the private insurance is more like an investment, where if you don't spend it for some years they will be returned to you at a higher rate
[2025/8/20 13:48:15] Sunaya: oh wow thats so good
[2025/8/20 13:48:24] Sunaya: its like putting in a abank
[2025/8/20 13:48:42] Eric Gao: my parents bought one or two for me when I was a kid, and I got it when I was 18
[2025/8/20 13:49:36] Eric Gao: yea.. the public insurance actually already covers enough things, the only issue is that the public insurance covers only few of the medicine that government likes. For example, the public insurance might only cover a specific brand of cough syrup because the medicine company is government owned
[2025/8/20 13:49:56] Sunaya: ohhhhh i see
[2025/8/20 13:50:01] Eric Gao: or because that medicine has a high profit margin and the hospital is govenmnet owned
[2025/8/20 13:50:03] Eric Gao: something along those lines
[2025/8/20 13:50:14] Eric Gao: so those might not be the best medicine
[2025/8/20 13:50:20] Sunaya: i see i see
[2025/8/20 13:50:42] Sunaya: most doctors i. nepal dont recommend medicine made in nepal cause it doesnt even work lol
[2025/8/20 13:51:19] Eric Gao: lol

[2025/9/9 17:46:49] Sunaya: yeah but thats suprising that that many voted

[2025/9/9 17:48:01] Eric Gao: this doesn't make sense, this means there are 230.77 votes in total
[2025/9/9 17:48:04] Eric Gao: numbers don't match
[2025/9/10 13:14:04] Eric Gao: On September 10, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian held a regular press conference.
A reporter asked: On September 9, Israel attacked Doha, the capital of Qatar, targeting Hamas leaders. What is China's response?
Lin Jian: China strongly condemns yesterday's attack in Doha, the capital of Qatar, and firmly opposes Israel's violation of Qatar's territorial sovereignty and national security. We are deeply concerned that the attack may further escalate regional tensions and express dissatisfaction with the actions of relevant parties to undermine the Gaza ceasefire negotiations. Peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved through force; dialogue and negotiation are the fundamental solution. The Gaza conflict has dragged on for nearly two years. China strongly urges all parties concerned, especially Israel, to make more proactive efforts to quell the fighting and restart negotiations, rather than to oppose them.
