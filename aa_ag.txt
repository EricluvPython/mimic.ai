[07/10/2023, 6:49:32 AM] Abdallah Jaleel: Oh hey
[07/10/2023, 6:51:13 AM] Abdallah Jaleel: I’m not done, but I’m writing about Roy and how he was originally created as a soldier, but then he changed to an empathetic being. I am then arguing that this change made Roy more human than human and I am also gonna talk about Ridley Scott’s meaning of human through Roy
[07/10/2023, 6:51:27 AM] Aditya G: wait do we not use cinematic effects?
[07/10/2023, 6:51:41 AM] Abdallah Jaleel: I think he would like that
[07/10/2023, 6:51:55 AM] Abdallah Jaleel: Bc analysis can come from many places

[07/10/2023, 6:52:41 AM] Abdallah Jaleel: Doesn’t seem to support a claim like this tbh
[07/10/2023, 6:52:44 AM] Aditya G: "interrogate concept of human"
[07/10/2023, 6:52:55 AM] Aditya G: that makes very little sense to me

[07/10/2023, 6:55:46 AM] Aditya G: oh right but the central claim has to be more related to the narrative

[11/11/2023, 2:44:48 PM] Aditya G: ohh
[11/11/2023, 2:44:52 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: just using specific narrative points from scenes

[11/11/2023, 2:44:58 PM] Aditya G: oh really

[11/11/2023, 2:45:18 PM] Aditya G: in both body paras

‎[17/11/2024, 9:54:42 PM] Aditya G: ‎image omitted
[17/11/2024, 11:02:44 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: When we spoke to him about it in this situation, he mentioned that because it’s expressed in the genotype as a mutant allele and not the phenotype we say it’s overdominance. At least that’s what I understood from him
[17/11/2024, 11:12:35 PM] Aditya G: that doesnt make sense tho
[17/11/2024, 11:13:30 PM] Aditya G: i think he mustve meant the advantage gained because of this

[17/11/2024, 11:14:40 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: But I don’t think he mentioned the advantage at all during my portion
[17/11/2024, 11:14:51 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: Because someone else is doing it after ig
[17/11/2024, 11:14:59 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: Although I agree that it is kind of weird ‎<This message was edited>
[17/11/2024, 11:21:59 PM] Aditya G: ohh
[17/11/2024, 11:22:17 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: Did I misunderstand or?
[17/11/2024, 11:23:32 PM] Aditya G: i think its not about being expressed in genotype and not phenotype
[17/11/2024, 11:24:25 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: I think it’s genotype and not phenotype
[17/11/2024, 11:24:33 PM] Aditya G: i think its the fact that HbA shows its phenotype and HbS is also expressed (although only in case of induced hypoxia)
[17/11/2024, 11:24:57 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: Isn’t that the same thing?
[17/11/2024, 11:25:10 PM] Aditya G: how tho
[17/11/2024, 11:25:44 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: Because we are saying it’s expressed in genotype but when talking about phenotype only HBa is expressed
[17/11/2024, 11:25:56 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: So HBs only genotype?
[17/11/2024, 11:26:07 PM] Aditya G: but then hows it different from any heterozygote?>
[17/11/2024, 11:27:00 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: I think it’s different bc when we go on to explain the idea that cells may sickle in certain conditions, it’s different than blood type for example
[17/11/2024, 11:27:15 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: Unless again I’m wrong
[17/11/2024, 11:27:32 PM] Aditya G: hmm if thats what u meant by expressed in genotype then ig we saying the same thing
[17/11/2024, 11:27:54 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: I believe I do mention that in certain conditions sickling may occur
[17/11/2024, 11:27:58 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: But I don’t mention any advantages
[17/11/2024, 11:28:02 PM] Abdallah Jaleel: Bc that’s not my part
[17/11/2024, 11:28:02 PM] Aditya G: alr
