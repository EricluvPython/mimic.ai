[2022/7/21 05:11:12] Eric Gao: Hi Sunaya, this is Eric from the Linux group. Just received that email from Mr. Juan, are you in Plaza Inn too?
[2022/7/21 05:21:28] Sunaya: Yes
[2022/7/21 05:22:02] Sunaya: My flight's on the 22nd
[2022/7/21 05:22:17] Sunaya: And I have to quarantine for a day
[2022/7/21 05:23:24] Sunaya: So I'll be there till 23-24
[2022/7/21 05:35:21] Eric Gao: oh ok
[2022/7/21 05:35:37] Eric Gao: I would quarantine for 5 days as I arrived on 19th, and I would leave on 24th
[2022/7/21 06:12:56] Sunaya: Are you staying there too?
[2022/7/21 06:13:20] Sunaya: Oh nice. We might run into each other there
[2022/7/21 06:15:10] Sunaya: Just saw the email, looks like we'll be traveling together
[2022/7/21 06:27:32] Eric Gao: yes I'm currently in plaza inn
[2022/7/21 06:28:34] Eric Gao: are you sure that you would leave on the 24th though? my flight arrived on 1am on the 20th, but since I booked the hotel for 5 days starting from 7.19, I could leave on the 24th
[2022/7/21 06:29:37] Eric Gao: so it doesn't really matter when you arrive (unless you check in too late, but in my case it wasn't even late). the hotel focuses more on your booking
[2022/7/21 06:37:39] Sunaya: Hmm right. I arrive on 22:45 and my booking's for the 22nd so I guess I could leave on the 23rd
[2022/7/23 09:09:11] Sunaya: Hey Eric, your quarantine's ending tomorrow right?
[2022/7/23 09:09:37] Sunaya: Mine ended today and I'm currently in the males qf housing
[2022/7/23 09:09:48] Eric Gao: yea I would get out tomorrow
[2022/7/23 09:09:57] Eric Gao: so great!
[2022/7/23 09:10:22] Sunaya: Yup just need the card to be ready and I'm good to go
[2022/7/23 09:10:38] Eric Gao: you mean the room card?
[2022/7/23 09:10:41] Sunaya: Yes
[2022/7/23 09:10:46] Eric Gao: oh ok
[2022/7/23 09:10:59] Eric Gao: do you like the student dorm?
[2022/7/23 09:11:17] Sunaya: Haven't been in yet? I'm in the waiting room
[2022/7/23 09:11:56] Eric Gao: oh ok
[2022/7/23 09:11:56] Sunaya: I've got some videos of the room tho. A friend of mine sent it to me
[2022/7/23 09:12:07] Eric Gao: yea I really liked the rooms from the video
[2022/7/23 09:12:17] Eric Gao: and the pictures

[2022/7/23 09:12:38] Eric Gao: what are you planning to do this afternoon?
[2022/7/23 09:12:56] Sunaya: Idk. Haven't thought of anything yet
[2022/7/23 09:13:16] Sunaya: I'll try to find other cmu plp and maybe we can do something together
[2022/7/23 09:13:41] Sunaya: I think imron already here right
[2022/7/23 09:13:43] Eric Gao: do you have a qatar phone card yet? i think it's best to get one. many apps such as delivery and taxi need a card
[2022/7/23 09:13:47] Eric Gao: yea imron is here
[2022/7/23 09:13:51] Eric Gao: you can text him
[2022/7/23 09:13:58] Sunaya: I bought one but it's a tourist one
[2022/7/23 09:14:17] Sunaya: It's only valid for like 7 days I'll buy a local one quickly
[2022/7/23 09:14:26] Eric Gao: yea good idea
[2022/7/23 09:14:33] Sunaya: Did you buy yours?
[2022/7/23 09:14:43] Sunaya: In the airport?
[2022/7/23 09:14:58] Eric Gao: no. unfortunately I didn't find the place in the airport😂
[2022/7/23 09:15:14] Eric Gao: it was in midnight and I couldn't wait for another second to go to bed
[2022/7/23 09:15:16] Sunaya: Haha I found the place but I didn't know they had a local and a tourist one
[2022/7/23 09:15:31] Sunaya: I just asked them to hand me a sim lol
[2022/7/23 09:15:36] Sunaya: Same
[2022/7/23 09:15:45] Eric Gao: I heard from some seniors that the vodafone has better signals in male student dorm
[2022/7/23 09:16:08] Sunaya: Nice I have orodee rn I'll buy Vodafone then
[2022/7/23 09:16:08] Eric Gao: you could ask imron though. he's been here a few days and he seems to know a bit around education city
[2022/7/23 09:16:17] Sunaya: Yeah that'll be ideal
[2022/7/23 09:16:46] Sunaya: Oh yeah I met Adan too today. She was in Plaza Inn too
[2022/7/23 09:17:08] Eric Gao: oh really? how amazingly coincidental😂
[2022/7/23 09:17:47] Eric Gao: you could find a local restaurant and have some non-quarantine food. i miss it so much
[2022/7/23 09:17:49] Sunaya: Ikr if only your quarantine was a day less we all wouldve met thete
[2022/7/23 09:17:52] Sunaya: There
[2022/7/23 09:17:58] Eric Gao: yea we would
[2022/7/23 09:18:09] Sunaya: Haha right. The quarantine food was so bad
[2022/7/23 09:18:18] Sunaya: I could barely finish half
[2022/7/23 09:18:22] Eric Gao: yea me too
[2022/7/23 09:18:28] Eric Gao: I didn't like the taste of the rice
[2022/7/23 09:18:31] Sunaya: And I was there for only a day.
[2022/7/23 09:18:46] Sunaya: The chicken was dry and bland too
[2022/7/23 09:19:05] Eric Gao: countless things to be criticized

[2022/8/4 04:12:36] Sunaya: Yes I think I'll ask him in person
[2022/8/4 04:12:47] Sunaya: What did he say in your email?
[2022/8/4 04:13:29] Eric Gao: Hi all,

I understand you have a conflict with your medical appointment that is difficult to change.

What you can do is go to the Medical Commision right after class, by 4pm. I recommend going at this time and not later than that, and definitely before 6pm. This may mean you miss other classes, but this is a mandatory government process and you need to get this done today.

For now, you are responsible for your own transportation - if that changes I will let you know.

Once you go, you will get your appointment receipts stamped, and once you have all done so, please go to the 1st floor to the X-ray section, and find Mr. Mohammad Abduljawar and explain that you are from CMUQ in QF, and he will help you get through the crowd.

If you still plan on going with the 1pm group, please reply and tell me.

Let me know if there are any issues.

Best,

[2022/8/21 02:57:07] Eric Gao: I know that he needs a monitor
[2022/8/21 02:57:12] Sunaya: Oh yeah
[2022/8/21 02:57:20] Sunaya: He's always talking about that
[2022/8/21 02:57:28] Eric Gao: but most monitors are like at least 1000 riiyals
[2022/8/21 02:57:43] Sunaya: Ikr too expensive
[2022/8/21 02:57:53] Sunaya: Anything else that he keeps mentioning
[2022/8/21 02:57:59] Eric Gao: also the body size pillow
[2022/8/21 02:58:06] Eric Gao: but I didn't find anywhere that sells them
[2022/8/21 02:58:07] Sunaya: Oh wow yeah
[2022/8/21 02:58:21] Sunaya: Did you ask hoalin he might know
[2022/8/21 02:58:34] Eric Gao: yea
[2022/8/21 02:59:04] Sunaya: What type of body pillow??
[2022/8/21 02:59:12] Sunaya: I saw one normal one in a mall
[2022/8/21 02:59:20] Sunaya: Anime one or a normal?
[2022/8/21 02:59:31] Eric Gao: he said normal one is fine, but what's the fun of it
[2022/8/21 02:59:49] Sunaya: Ikr
[2022/8/21 03:00:05] Eric Gao: better be some nsfw things on the pillow
[2022/8/21 03:00:05] Sunaya: There's normals ones I'll try to find an anime one
[2022/8/21 03:00:10] Eric Gao: and let's also buy him a condom
[2022/8/21 03:00:34] Sunaya: Yess
[2022/8/21 03:00:55] Sunaya: I wanted to buy you one as well but yeah
[2022/8/21 03:01:25] Eric Gao: I'm 18 now so I can properly buy one
[2022/8/21 03:01:45] Sunaya: i think in qatar you need to be married to buy one
[2022/8/21 03:01:54] Sunaya: you need to show your marriage certificate lol
[2022/8/21 03:01:59] Eric Gao: oh really
[2022/8/21 03:02:07] Sunaya: nah i'm joking
[2022/8/21 03:02:13] Sunaya: but it's probably true considering qatar
[2022/8/21 03:02:35] Eric Gao: yea
[2022/8/21 03:04:18] Sunaya: we could buy a normal body pillow and buy a seperate nsfw body pillow cover
[2022/8/21 03:04:34] Eric Gao: I'm not sure where we could find the nsfw cover
[2022/8/21 03:04:49] Sunaya: okay not nsfw but anime cover
[2022/8/21 03:05:01] Eric Gao: it's so easy in China to get a customized body pillow
[2022/8/21 03:05:22] Eric Gao: you order on taobao and 3 days later it's in your house
[2022/8/21 03:05:48] Eric Gao: also I'm not sure where to find the anime cover
[2022/8/21 03:05:56] Sunaya: hmm lemeee ask some qatari residents if they know
[2022/8/21 03:06:15] Sunaya: body pillow would be such a good gift for lorenzo
[2022/8/21 03:06:25] Sunaya: so sad that you find nothing in qatar
[2022/8/21 03:06:54] Eric Gao: yea
[2022/8/21 03:07:14] Eric Gao: I think there is an anime store in villagio
[2022/8/21 03:07:25] Eric Gao: if anything, it would be our best chance
[2022/8/21 03:09:05] Eric Gao: btw I know that buying condom in saudi arabia needs a marriage licsence
[2022/8/21 03:09:22] Sunaya: lol
[2022/8/21 03:09:35] Sunaya: could be same in qatar you never know
[2022/8/21 03:13:03] Eric Gao: I just searched and it says: if the pharmarcy store owner suspects you of premarriage sex, he would report you to the police
[2022/8/21 03:13:44] Sunaya: damn yeah let's not buy
[2022/8/21 03:29:37] Sunaya: eric for the concepts hw the last sets one can we use de morgans law and other set identical theories to prove if the sets are equivalent

[2022/9/11 14:28:40] Eric Gao: You wanna team with me?
[2022/9/11 14:28:41] Sunaya: i'm participating haven't registered yet tho
[2022/9/11 14:28:52] Eric Gao: Mohamed asked me to team with him
[2022/9/11 14:28:58] Eric Gao: The one with short hair
[2022/9/11 14:29:06] Sunaya: yea sure
[2022/9/11 14:29:09] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/9/11 14:29:56] Sunaya: who else is on the team
[2022/9/11 14:30:05] Eric Gao: Just us 3
[2022/9/11 14:30:26] Sunaya: also wait let me ask zeina and aditya since i teamed up with them last time. if they aren't participating i'm teaming up with you
[2022/9/11 14:31:10] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/9/12 03:48:30] Eric Gao: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lfgSeu0nLhk
[2022/9/12 03:48:35] Eric Gao: This you?
[2022/9/13 00:52:10] Sunaya: I'll be a bit late
[2022/9/13 00:53:26] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/9/14 11:41:56] Sunaya: eric how do you do the concepts hw no 2
 i proved that its injective how do i prove its surjective
[2022/9/14 11:43:37] Eric Gao: express x'=x+y y'=2y+z z'=x-z in terms of x y z
[2022/9/14 11:44:21] Eric Gao: e.g. x=ax'+by'+cz' etc.
[2022/9/14 11:48:56] Sunaya: did you find the inverse and prove that it's a bijection?
[2022/9/14 11:49:08] Eric Gao: after you express those
[2022/9/14 11:49:16] Eric Gao: put them into f(x,y,z)
[2022/9/14 11:49:28] Eric Gao: and you'll get f=(x,y,z)
[2022/9/14 11:49:51] Eric Gao: it's not technically a inverse
[2022/9/14 11:50:03] Eric Gao: because inverse would require it to be bijection
[2022/9/14 11:50:06] Eric Gao: which we need to prove now
[2022/9/14 11:50:14] Sunaya: oh from the inverse get the values of x y and z
[2022/9/14 11:50:29] Sunaya: and use that to show that it's surjective right
[2022/9/14 11:51:20] Eric Gao: same as how you prove other things are surjective
[2022/9/14 11:51:29] Sunaya: oh right right
[2022/9/14 11:51:30] Sunaya: i got it
[2022/9/14 11:51:32] Eric Gao: suppose there is (x,y,z) in R3
[2022/9/14 11:51:42] Eric Gao: and so on
[2022/9/15 00:57:32] Sunaya: I am in the lobby
[2022/9/15 09:37:13] Sunaya: I'm in library when you're going to guq let me know
[2022/9/15 09:40:49] Eric Gao: ok
[2022/9/17 02:16:06] Sunaya: Eric what do you use to clean the bathroom floors?
[2022/9/17 02:16:17] Eric Gao: mob

[2022/9/23 04:06:02] Eric Gao: for phones yes because you could easily drop them
[2022/9/23 04:06:05] Sunaya: You never know if you'd don't try. Learning experience
[2022/9/23 04:06:33] Eric Gao: you don't need protector for ipad the same reason you don't need protective cases for laptop
[2022/9/23 04:06:59] Eric Gao: a large and flat surface like that gets crushed no matter what you do
[2022/9/23 04:07:24] Sunaya: Too dumb to thin

[2022/9/23 04:08:35] Sunaya: It's so bad
[2022/9/23 04:08:36] Eric Gao: why is the screen protector bad?
[2022/9/23 04:08:49] Sunaya: I bought paper like protector
[2022/9/23 04:08:59] Sunaya: So writing is paper like

[2022/9/26 11:25:33] Sunaya: Yeah a headphone
[2022/9/26 11:25:40] Eric Gao: ???????
[2022/9/26 11:25:54] Eric Gao: you might want to watch out for her
[2022/9/26 11:26:04] Eric Gao: today's candy may become tomorrow's whip
[2022/9/26 11:26:13] Eric Gao: I mean sexually
[2022/9/26 11:26:57] Eric Gao: and I'm looking forward to being "friends" with her
[2022/9/26 11:27:07] Sunaya: What the heck
[2022/9/26 11:28:36] Eric Gao: why did she give this to you
[2022/9/26 11:28:40] Eric Gao: you wanted it so badly?
[2022/9/26 11:28:44] Sunaya: No
[2022/9/26 11:28:53] Sunaya: Because I won Aditya in rock paper scissors
[2022/9/26 11:29:03] Eric Gao: what?
[2022/9/26 11:29:08] Sunaya: She said whoever wins would get one

[2022/9/26 11:29:25] Eric Gao: fuck
[2022/9/26 11:29:31] Sunaya: I thought she was joking
[2022/9/26 11:29:47] Sunaya: I was speechless when she handed me that
[2022/9/26 11:31:42] Sunaya: I still don't know what to do? Like what I just can't think straight
[2022/9/26 11:31:58] Sunaya: How can someone just hand me something so expensive
[2022/9/26 11:34:08] Eric Gao: this is what she wanted
[2022/9/26 11:34:40] Eric Gao: that you become puzzled and you start trying to offer her your personal values to compensate for the expensive gift and gradually you become her sex slave
[2022/9/26 11:35:04] Eric Gao: or it's just like she actually doesn't care
[2022/9/26 11:35:23] Eric Gao: you would feel more self-respect if you think the former way
[2022/9/26 11:35:54] Eric Gao: but the later is more possible
[2022/9/26 11:36:02] Eric Gao: or is it?

[2022/10/26 13:57:15] Eric Gao: ok
[2022/10/26 13:57:21] Eric Gao: how's it going with your project
[2022/10/26 13:59:57] Sunaya: no progress, I started creating the player, drawing him and then it just went downhill
[2022/10/26 14:00:19] Sunaya: but now i'm using tiled to create the map and character once that's done i'll work on the player and then enemies
[2022/10/26 14:00:39] Sunaya: oh yeah and I looked over brotato my game will be similar
[2022/10/26 14:02:52] Eric Gao: brotato is a very small game of its genre but it's still way too big for your project
[2022/10/26 14:02:57] Sunaya: code wise it's still TP1 no progess from tp1
[2022/10/26 14:03:19] Eric Gao: and don't start with player drawing, it takes much more time and thinking than writing code
[2022/10/26 14:03:38] Eric Gao: find some sample art online and change them afterwards
[2022/10/26 14:03:47] Sunaya: yea ig I'll do that

‎[2022/11/5 13:02:07] Sunaya:‎<附件：00001351-PHOTO-2022-11-05-13-02-07.jpg>

‎[2022/11/5 13:18:39] Sunaya:‎<附件：00001355-PHOTO-2022-11-05-13-18-39.jpg>
[2022/11/5 13:18:57] Sunaya: i  think the ans for 4 is this
[2022/11/5 13:32:39] Eric Gao: you're right
[2022/11/5 13:32:57] Eric Gao: it is the 4th calculation error I made on this single homework in less than 2 hours
[2022/11/5 13:33:01] Eric Gao: I might have brain cancer
[2022/11/5 13:38:51] Sunaya: for 3 you got m = 0.5 and b = 0.25 right?
[2022/11/5 13:49:09] Eric Gao: Yes
[2022/11/6 03:53:18] Sunaya: eric
[2022/11/6 03:53:31] Eric Gao: sunaya

[2022/11/6 03:55:09] Sunaya: idk what to say i'm thinking
[2022/11/6 03:55:49] Sunaya: as soon as you see Lorenzo tell him i'm looking fo r him
[2022/11/6 03:56:05] Sunaya: i need to calculate how much i need in the final for matrices to get an A
[2022/11/6 03:57:35] Eric Gao: what's the point in knowing it
[2022/11/6 03:57:40] Sunaya: i don't think i'll get an A
[2022/11/6 03:57:52] Sunaya: cause like my percent is 95.16 now
[2022/11/6 03:57:55] Eric Gao: does that affect in anyways who you are or what you do?
[2022/11/6 03:58:15] Eric Gao: remember last time I got 80 for concepts midterm? my average dropped to 90.5
[2022/11/6 03:58:16] Sunaya: if i get 60 in this midterm i will need to get 100% in the final right?
[2022/11/6 03:59:07] Eric Gao: ignorance is bless, always
[2022/11/6 03:59:32] Eric Gao: if you knowing it doesn't make a positive influence compared to not knowing it, don't try to know it
[2022/11/6 04:00:18] Eric Gao: 2 things I always tell myself: there are things I cannot do and thus I won't do, and there are things I cannot know and thus I won't know
[2022/11/6 04:00:39] Sunaya: knowing it would give let me know if i could get an A or B and plan accordingly
[2022/11/6 04:00:46] Eric Gao: plan for an A, always
[2022/11/6 04:01:13] Eric Gao: at least for me so that I don't suffer the pain of knowing stuff
[2022/11/6 04:02:26] Eric Gao: actually plan for doing your best, no matter the result
[2022/11/6 04:02:42] Eric Gao: remember prof. Saquib said to enjoy the process not the results
[2022/11/6 04:03:52] Eric Gao: and I've known you for 3 months. not even once did you let me down
[2022/11/6 04:04:11] Sunaya: i checked my concepts

[2022/11/6 04:04:47] Sunaya: i was amazed as you were
[2022/11/6 04:05:26] Sunaya: now i feel like all that i said before is invalidated
[2022/11/6 04:06:56] Sunaya: i feel so embrassed now
[2022/11/6 04:09:45] Sunaya: what do this mean? are you angry i literally didn't know
[2022/11/6 04:09:57] Eric Gao: no I'm not angry
[2022/11/6 04:10:34] Eric Gao: and I'm happy that you got good grades
[2022/11/6 04:10:47] Eric Gao: I'm just trying to mock you for showing all the drama
[2022/11/6 04:11:08] Sunaya: i know but i didn't wanna do that. i was just expressing what i felt
[2022/11/6 04:11:16] Eric Gao: that's why I wasn't angry
[2022/11/6 04:11:38] Eric Gao: and you won't know if I'm angry if I'm truly angry
[2022/11/6 04:11:48] Eric Gao: I'm expressing my feelings only when they are useful
[2022/11/6 04:12:16] Eric Gao: anyways now that you're happier, try to worry less about matrix
[2022/11/6 04:16:26] Sunaya: anyways, i'm sorry i was too dramatic i really didn't want it to happen that way
[2022/11/6 04:16:46] Eric Gao: No don’t be sorry
[2022/11/6 04:17:33] Eric Gao: Next time don’t worry too much about things that are already done

[2022/11/13 23:46:30] Eric Gao: No
[2022/11/13 23:47:06] Sunaya: At 8?

[2022/11/13 23:47:40] Eric Gao: Come get me when you’re ready
[2022/11/13 23:47:45] Sunaya: Ok
[2022/11/14 00:44:19] Sunaya: eric how would you do c) using answer from b)
‎[2022/11/14 00:44:22] Sunaya:‎<附件：00001500-PHOTO-2022-11-14-00-44-22.jpg>
[2022/11/14 00:44:42] Sunaya: the prof said the answer is 3v1
[2022/11/14 00:45:00] Eric Gao: I forgot what b is
[2022/11/14 00:45:27] Eric Gao: It’s a stochastic matrix so 1 is the dominant eigenvalue
[2022/11/14 00:45:44] Sunaya: yea but A is stochastic matrix
[2022/11/14 00:45:46] Eric Gao: It tends to the eigenvector corresponding to 1
[2022/11/14 00:46:12] Sunaya: is A^k stochastic matrix as well?
[2022/11/14 00:46:29] Eric Gao: It should be
[2022/11/14 00:46:39] Eric Gao: I don’t know
[2022/11/14 00:47:00] Eric Gao: w is the x0 in this case
[2022/11/14 00:47:19] Eric Gao: If you write x0 as c1v1+c2v2+c3v3
[2022/11/14 00:47:55] Eric Gao: Then A^kx0=c1lambda1^k+…
[2022/11/14 00:48:13] Eric Gao: Then A^kx0=c1lambda1^kv1+…
[2022/11/14 00:49:14] Sunaya: yea that the other two become zero but c1A^kv1 is not zero but I don't get it
[2022/11/14 00:49:21] Sunaya: wait I'll come in your room
[2022/11/14 02:35:16] Sunaya: Eric do you have extra pen I can borrow for today?

[2022/11/14 02:54:27] Eric Gao: lemme go ask
[2022/11/14 02:55:09] Sunaya: transpose(A)*b = projB onto A right?
[2022/11/14 02:58:56] Eric Gao: maybe
[2022/11/14 03:34:17] Sunaya: Imma go sleep
[2022/11/14 03:34:58] Sunaya: Let's eat food at 1230 from the cafeteria

[2022/11/14 03:35:15] Sunaya: Incase I don't wake up knock on my door
[2022/11/14 03:35:21] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/11/14 04:27:40] Sunaya: I am awake
[2022/11/14 04:27:49] Sunaya: I'll shower and come to the common area

[2022/11/18 22:39:41] Eric Gao: No thanks
[2022/11/18 22:41:10] Eric Gao: You could take them with you to indigrill
[2022/11/20 16:26:19] Sunaya: What you doing?
[2022/11/20 16:26:41] Eric Gao: Walking around airport looking at things I have no money to buy
[2022/11/20 16:27:22] Sunaya: Only an hour and half to go?
[2022/11/20 16:27:28] Eric Gao: Yes
[2022/11/20 16:27:38] Sunaya: Send proof
[2022/11/20 16:28:06] Eric Gao: Penhaligon perfumes cost 150 dollars
[2022/11/20 16:28:33] Sunaya: Proff you're in the airport
[2022/11/20 16:28:38] Eric Gao: This place doesn’t sell any silver stuff, only gold and jewelry
[2022/11/20 16:28:56] Sunaya: How much was the cheapest one?
[2022/11/20 16:29:01] Sunaya: Necklace
[2022/11/20 16:29:07] Sunaya: And was it goof
[2022/11/20 16:29:18] Eric Gao: Proof by contradiction: if I weren’t in airport, I would have been asleep. QED
[2022/11/20 16:29:26] Eric Gao: 150 dollars
[2022/11/20 16:29:32] Eric Gao: What is good
[2022/11/20 16:29:36] Eric Gao: *goof
[2022/11/20 16:29:48] Sunaya: What do you rate your necklace
[2022/11/20 16:31:13] Eric Gao: 8/10
[2022/11/20 16:31:30] Eric Gao: Since it’s supposed to be silver but it started turning black
[2022/11/20 16:31:42] Sunaya: Okay compared to that how much would you rate this
[2022/11/20 16:31:59] Eric Gao: No this is the perfume price
[2022/11/20 16:32:11] Eric Gao: Necklace I didn’t even dare to ask
[2022/11/20 16:32:41] Sunaya: Oh I thought you were talking a out he necklace
[2022/11/20 16:32:52] Sunaya: How much was yours tho
[2022/11/20 16:33:01] Eric Gao: I think the cheapest would cost at least 10k riyals
[2022/11/20 16:33:13] Eric Gao: No idea. My mom bought it
[2022/11/20 16:33:21] Sunaya: wtf so expensive
[2022/11/20 16:33:31] Sunaya: But ig it's supposed to be
[2022/11/20 16:33:38] Sunaya: so no complain
[2022/11/20 16:33:42] Eric Gao: The cheaper ones are pure gold
[2022/11/20 16:33:51] Eric Gao: The more expensive ones are pure gold with diamonds
[2022/11/20 16:34:43] Sunaya: What do you rate the Doha airport
[2022/11/20 16:34:51] Sunaya: Compared to china's
[2022/11/20 16:34:55] Eric Gao: 10/10
[2022/11/20 16:35:11] Eric Gao: The biggest and best decorated airport
[2022/11/20 16:35:22] Eric Gao: With no over overpriced stuff
[2022/11/20 16:35:29] Sunaya: Damn we should have come with you
[2022/11/20 16:35:41] Sunaya: Go window shopping in the airport
[2022/11/20 16:35:59] Sunaya: maybe get some stuff
[2022/11/20 16:36:08] Sunaya: Didn't think you'd rate this
[2022/11/20 16:36:23] Eric Gao: Using the money from selling your kidney?
[2022/11/20 16:36:45] Eric Gao: Well maybe 9/10 because I can’t buy anything because everything is too expensive
[2022/11/20 16:36:56] Eric Gao: And there’s too many people today
[2022/11/20 16:36:57] Sunaya: don't have a kidney
[2022/11/20 16:37:15] Sunaya: Contradiction
[2022/11/20 16:37:20] Sunaya: Contradiction
[2022/11/20 16:37:48] Eric Gao: I said over overpriced, not overpriced
[2022/11/20 16:38:14] Eric Gao: Things are expensive but are close to or even cheaper than the normal tax-free market price
[2022/11/20 16:38:38] Eric Gao: In Chinese airports one kfc would cost 50 riyals and you don’t even get full
[2022/11/20 16:39:06] Eric Gao: And all the souvenirs are twice the price compared to outside
[2022/11/20 16:39:33] Sunaya: it's similar to Nepal it's like 3x more
[2022/11/20 16:39:44] Eric Gao: Why are you not sleeping
‎[2022/11/20 16:40:08] Sunaya:‎<附件：00001604-PHOTO-2022-11-20-16-40-08.jpg>
[2022/11/20 16:40:19] Sunaya: Playing games
[2022/11/20 16:40:32] Eric Gao: It’s generally a bad idea to play game over night
[2022/11/20 16:40:51] Sunaya: Yea but I have a lot to complete no time to waste
[2022/11/20 16:40:59] Eric Gao: 80% of the sudden death cases I know of happened during playing game at 1am
[2022/11/20 16:41:18] Eric Gao: You also have a long life to live
[2022/11/20 16:42:18] Sunaya: and a lot of game to play
[2022/11/20 16:43:12] Eric Gao: Do you prefer gaming over living or living over gaming
[2022/11/20 16:43:26] Sunaya: def gaming over living
[2022/11/20 16:43:32] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/11/20 16:43:37] Sunaya: wouldn't you too
[2022/11/20 16:43:40] Eric Gao: No
[2022/11/20 16:43:48] Sunaya: There's no fun in living who would want to live
[2022/11/20 16:43:48] Eric Gao: I want to suffer over eternity
[2022/11/20 16:44:21] Sunaya: You haven't experienced suffering that's why you want it
[2022/11/20 16:45:20] Eric Gao: Maybe maybe not
[2022/11/20 16:45:28] Sunaya: people always want something what they don't have
[2022/11/20 16:45:45] Eric Gao: In eternity suffering and not suffering would not distinguish from each other
[2022/11/20 16:46:22] Eric Gao: I don’t have AIDS but I don’t want it. Proof with counter example
[2022/11/20 16:46:25] Sunaya: So why chose suffering? Choose not suffering for eternity if it is the same
[2022/11/20 16:46:43] Eric Gao: Not the same because I need to type additional characters
[2022/11/20 16:47:19] Sunaya: would you want to suffer now?
[2022/11/20 16:47:26] Sunaya: and suffer in what way
[2022/11/20 16:47:41] Eric Gao: Suffer from suffer
[2022/11/20 16:47:49] Eric Gao: Recursive definition
[2022/11/20 16:47:59] Sunaya: What's the base caee
[2022/11/20 16:48:00] Eric Gao: With no base case
[2022/11/20 16:48:13] Eric Gao: The same way you define the word intelligence
[2022/11/20 16:48:30] Sunaya: I haven't defined it
[2022/11/20 16:48:41] Eric Gao: Recursively defined on the approximation to human intelligence
[2022/11/20 16:49:04] Sunaya: What's the recursive case then
[2022/11/20 16:49:15] Eric Gao: Suffer from the existing suffering
[2022/11/20 16:49:34] Eric Gao: Maybe. I don’t really know
[2022/11/20 16:49:45] Sunaya: how much of an increment each time when you call the func again
[2022/11/20 16:50:04] Eric Gao: Some increment
[2022/11/20 16:50:13] Sunaya: how long does each loop take to reach the func call again
[2022/11/20 16:50:21] Eric Gao: Some time
[2022/11/20 16:50:39] Sunaya: yea very accurate stuff
[2022/11/20 16:50:49] Sunaya: you'll be a mathematician in no time
[2022/11/20 16:50:51] Eric Gao: You cannot really define human
[2022/11/20 16:51:06] Eric Gao: Are you a human and how do you know it
[2022/11/20 16:51:36] Sunaya: It's just a noun
[2022/11/20 16:51:52] Sunaya: what a noun?
[2022/11/20 16:52:09] Sunaya: It's just a sequence of letters
[2022/11/20 16:52:20] Eric Gao: Noun is the grammatical definition, not the definition on its meaning
[2022/11/20 16:52:22] Sunaya: What's a sequence, what's letters?
[2022/11/20 16:52:35] Sunaya: It's just stuff
[2022/11/20 16:52:38] Sunaya: What's stuff?
[2022/11/20 16:52:42] Sunaya: It's things
[2022/11/20 16:52:51] Sunaya: What's things?
[2022/11/20 16:53:08] Eric Gao: Ok stop and go play your games
[2022/11/20 16:53:14] Sunaya: okok
[2022/11/20 16:53:34] Sunaya: you get a cozy chair and play some too
[2022/11/20 16:53:43] Eric Gao: Or suddenly die or sleep
[2022/11/20 16:54:13] Sunaya: I walked a lot today there's no way I'd die
[2022/11/20 16:54:25] Eric Gao: It doesn’t have to do with walking
[2022/11/20 16:56:34] Sunaya: agree to disagree
[2022/11/20 16:56:46] Eric Gao: There’s one way to find out
[2022/11/20 16:58:00] Sunaya: I'll play until 2 let's see who's right
[2022/11/20 16:58:19] Eric Gao: let me know if you die
[2022/11/20 16:58:33] Sunaya: Ok I'll msg here
[2022/11/20 16:58:41] Sunaya: once I die
[2022/11/20 17:36:52] Sunaya: still going strong
[2022/11/20 17:38:41] Eric Gao: 22 more minutes to go
[2022/11/20 17:39:03] Eric Gao: Usually there is no warning
[2022/11/20 18:00:16] Sunaya: am dead
[2022/11/20 23:04:01] Eric Gao: Ok
[2022/11/20 23:04:07] Eric Gao: I finally got internet
[2022/11/21 00:07:04] Sunaya: Good
[2022/11/21 02:08:02] Sunaya: you reached your home?
[2022/11/21 02:11:00] Eric Gao: At hk now
[2022/11/21 02:18:19] Sunaya: do you need to quarantine there before you go to your place or no?
[2022/11/21 02:19:22] Eric Gao: Yea
[2022/11/21 02:19:27] Eric Gao: 3 days in hk
[2022/11/21 02:19:34] Eric Gao: Then 8 days in mainland
[2022/11/21 02:19:39] Eric Gao: Then I go back to my house
[2022/11/22 07:30:59] Eric Gao: You know what I’m going to ask
[2022/11/22 07:32:08] Eric Gao: To answer the question that you’ll ask, 100
[2022/11/22 07:50:20] Sunaya: What?
[2022/11/22 07:50:39] Eric Gao: We had a bet
[2022/11/22 07:50:45] Eric Gao: On your matrices
[2022/11/22 07:50:50] Eric Gao: 77
[2022/11/22 07:51:40] Sunaya: Yea we did, it was for the third midterm that I'd get less than 70
[2022/11/22 07:51:45] Sunaya: And I lost
[2022/11/22 07:52:01] Sunaya: Also Enoch was wrong ig
[2022/11/22 07:53:21] Eric Gao: Oh we didn’t have a bet on 77 for the final?
[2022/11/22 07:53:33] Sunaya: No
[2022/11/22 07:53:55] Sunaya: why would I bet on it, the qns were easy
[2022/11/22 07:54:22] Sunaya: i grabbed the calculator that was numbered 77 tho cause I got 77 previously
[2022/11/22 07:55:29] Eric Gao: Oh right
[2022/11/22 07:55:37] Sunaya: What did you get?
[2022/11/22 07:55:45] Sunaya: 100?
[2022/11/22 07:56:05] Sunaya: So we were right about the proof?
[2022/11/22 07:56:14] Eric Gao: See I did predict correctly
[2022/11/22 07:56:33] Sunaya: You'll ask mine now
[2022/11/22 07:56:36] Eric Gao: And I *proved* it right haha
[2022/11/22 07:57:05] Eric Gao: I wasn’t actually laughing. It’s a sarcastic haha to mock the bad pun
[2022/11/22 07:57:16] Eric Gao: Yes
[2022/11/22 07:58:16] Sunaya: See u predicted you too
[2022/11/22 07:58:19] Sunaya: I
[2022/11/22 07:58:43] Eric Gao: You need to prove that you predicted before you told me your prediction
[2022/11/22 07:58:55] Eric Gao: I proved by providing the answer not the question
[2022/11/22 07:59:24] Eric Gao: Because me seeing the question changes what I might ask
[2022/11/22 07:59:43] Sunaya: I don't get it but anyways I got 97. I lost 3 on I think the determinant cause I got the wrong value
[2022/11/22 08:00:09] Sunaya: Also this how tho?
[2022/11/22 08:00:36] Eric Gao: Nicenice. Only a calculation error
[2022/11/22 08:00:39] Eric Gao: Wdym
[2022/11/22 08:01:00] Sunaya: The proof that about the transpose being orthonormal
[2022/11/22 08:01:10] Eric Gao: I don’t know
[2022/11/22 08:01:15] Eric Gao: I might still be right
[2022/11/22 08:01:45] Sunaya: how cause Enoch showed me it was wrong using an example
[2022/11/22 08:01:50] Eric Gao: If A has orthonormal columns biimplies A^-1=A^T
[2022/11/22 08:01:59] Sunaya: Yea I did the same thing
[2022/11/22 08:01:59] Eric Gao: 🤔
[2022/11/22 08:02:15] Eric Gao: Ask him if he got calxulation rrror
